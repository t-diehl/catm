"1","001.txt","How Obama Used The DOJ To Destroy A Reporters Life And Blanket Full Immunity Over Clinton","A quick trip down memory lane causes a stumble over this gem from Obama. He was gearing up for his first run at the office of President and was spewing lies all over the American public.



Ill make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the peoples business.

He is finally living up to that with less than a month left to his Presidency. He is not bothering to hide the dirty business he conducts, because he just doesnt care anymore. Recent months aside, everything that Obama pledged regarding transparency was smoke and mirrors.

Many are speculating that he will step up and stop talking about the Hillary email scandal and simply pardon her from any prosecution. It is in his best interest to do so. His attempts to marginalize the issue by nitpicking the statutory categories of confidential, secret and top secret by commenting that theres classified and then theres classified were not successful. He then took up the Clinton rhetoric of Russian spies. Since emails from the President to the unsecure Clinton email were found, it is likely that he will try and end the scandal while he still has the power to do so.

A reporter with first-hand knowledge sums up Obamas transparent government, Obama and his team criminalized reporting, becoming the most secretive White House since Richard Nixon.

A message on the White House website from Obama makes it clear he still maintains the illusion that his office upheld the pledge of transparency;

My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government.  We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.

Every action taken by Barack Hussein Obama was calculated. He knew, as did his advisors and supporters, that he was actively engaged in deception against the United States. David Axelrod was the Chief Strategist for both of Obamas campaigns. He also served as Senior Adviser to the President until 2011.

He was positioned to not only witness the secrecy that Obama demanded but he was also part of it. After leaving the Obama administration, Axelrod began to hint that things were quite different if we only looked below the surface.

Some of his revelations regarding Obama continue to come as a shock to people who the President painted with the colors of truth.

Obama lied about his support FOR same-sex marriage before announcing his support for it in 2012. Yet if Obamas views were evolving publicly, they were fully evolved behind closed doors, Axelrod writes. The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed.
Obama chewed out Maureen Dowd on the campaign plane during the 2008 campaign. No one got under Baracks skin more than Maureen  He was patronizing and disrespectful. This is a direct contradiction to the calm, composed, Obama that Axelrod had helped to portray. He even lashed out at Axelrod.
Obama can have a short fuse, though he hides it from the public: The president called Axelrod a motherr and stalked out of a meeting after his strategist criticized the presidents debating techniques as Obama prepared for his 2012 debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney says Axelrod.
While those incidents speak to Obamas two-faced behavior, some of the secrecy of his administration can be summed up as simply lies;

Lie: Obama has told the world there has never been a better friend of Israel in the White House.

Truth: In September 2012, an Israeli newspaper reported that senior Obama Administration officials have told Tehran that Barack Obama does not intend to join Israel in any attack on Irans nuclear installations.

Lie: In May 2011, Obama said the fence between America and Mexico was basically complete.

Truth: The Department of Homeland Security admits just 36.3 miles or 5% of the border is fenced.

Lie: Obama lied and said abortions would not be publicly funded under Obamacare.

Truth: A March 2012 edict from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) unequivocally ruled Obamacare will use our tax dollars to fund abortion.

Ben Rhodes was Obamas partner in crime when it comes to one of the biggest lies of the administration; the Iran nuclear treaty. Rhodes, Obamas Deputy National Security Adviser, openly admitted his contempt for journalists, All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus. Now they dont. They call us to explain to them whats happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. Thats a sea change. They literally know nothing.

He later admitted more to David Samuels, a writer profiling Rhodes for a New York Times Magazine cover story; In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. We created an echo chamber. They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say. Rhodes was obviously not ashamed to display his contempt.

Fast forward to the present day and the new level of corruption that Obama reached when dealing with journalist James Rosen. In 2006, Risen published State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration. Unsurprisingly, President Bush did not take kindly to the book and his administration turned the whole situation into an investigation of government whistleblowers.

Risen was subpoenaed to reveal his sources, something he vehemently refused to do. He speaks about the attempt by Presidents to try and spin these stories; Well, they have gone after investigative reporting. They try to take, essentially, stories that they dont like, and try to find some classified information that might be part of that, and then turn it into a criminal leak investigation in which they say someone mishandled or disclosed classified information. As you know, you could do that with virtually any story in Washington.

Since then Risen has fought the Bush administration and then the Obama administration. In 2009, Obama took a rather unprecedented step of renewing a subpoena scheduled to expire that year. He was probably hoping nobody remembered that when in 2014 speech he told reporters; Here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.

In 2010, despite Risen keeping his sources confidential, the federal government indicted Jeffrey A. Sterling, a former CIA operative, with leaking the classified information to Risen. He continued his defiance, facing jail time, when the government ordered him to appear as a witness at the trial of Sterling.

Finally in January of 2015, after 7 years of uncertainty, the government decided not to call Risen in the trial. His fight for the truth had finally won.

Risen is a good example of how the Obama administration has fought the very ideas that he promised to uphold. It is very likely that we will see more insiders coming forward to open up about Obamas years in the White House. The truth would be a refreshing change.

A supporter of Risen, Jerry Kammer, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies, has this to say about President Obama;

He promised to be a different kind of president. But he has only suppressed efforts to disclose the governments misdeeds. His administration has been untransparent at so many levels.",1

Obamas massive ego and thin skin now has him publicly degrading Trumps landslide Electoral College victory and diligently working behind the scenes to thwart the will of the people.

Barack Obama sat in the Oval Office with Donald Trump about one month ago and vowed to do his best to foster a peaceful transition of power and to carry out the desire of the American people. Those lofty sentiments turned snarky quickly when it came time for Obama to start packing up his belongings and vacate the peoples house.

Over the course of the past month, Obama added a record number of new regulations across a myriad of federal agencies that try to control our lives  and livelihoods. In the past few days, he surpassed his own record and likely isnt done trying to curtail President-Elect Trumps authority after he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

Obama instructed his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from a vote which drastically impacted one of our most staunch allies, Israel. A veto by the United States, which has been done in the past, would have prevented the U.N. Security Council from attempting to create a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians by demanding that settlement building in disputed areas cease immediately.

Very quietly, Obama also welcomed more than 2,000 new Muslim refugees onto American soil. These people, largely men, already had their asylum requests denied by the Australian government. They were being held in a detention facility when Obama decided the American taxpayers should begin paying for their resettlement  regardless of the risks to national security.

President Obama had heralded George W. Bushs commitment to a respectful transition and promised his distraught staff would adhere to the same level of professionalism and decorum. Instead, he led the charge to behave like a petulant spoiled child himself.

First, Michelle Obama sat down for a chat with Oprah Winfrey and claimed America is now without hope. Tens of millions of Americans are feeling hopeful for the first time in eight years, but those of us who live in flyover country or are part of blue collar communities or the middle class really dont matter to liberals.

Lashing out at Donald Trump because We the People chose him over a corrupt, lying career politician simply showcases how shallow and self-involved Barack Obama and his wife truly are. There is nothing Democrats in Congress can do to stop Trumps agenda from passingthanks to Harry Reids short-sighted pushing for the nuclear option.

Michael Moore and his horde of liberal followers will not be able to stop Trump from being sworn in on January 20  nor will they succeed in pushing his oath-taking ceremony inside. The efforts of #Disrupt20 protesters will fail just as surely as Jill Steins recount endeavors.

If Barack Obama wanted his legacy to involve appearing small, glib, and completely delusional, he has succeeded. He is now nothing more than a frustrating nuisance for President-Elect Donald Trump and the patriotic Americans who cast ballots in his favor. Soon Obama will finally be gone, and Trump can repeal his foolish liberal regulations and executive orders and put the nation back on the track to greatness and prosperity for ALL!",1
"3","003.txt","Turkeys Erdogan Says U.S. Supports ISIL: We Have Evidence With Pictures & Videos","Turkeys President Recep Erdogan has come out swinging today. With the U.S. led coalition (Britain and France included) recently suffering an embarrassing defeat in Aleppo, Syria when Iranian and Russian forces helped to liberate the city from ISIL, this latest incident could be seen as Turkey throwing salt on the U.S. wound. 

Erdogans bombshell statements highlighted what most of the world is now coming to accept as reality:

They [the U.S.] give support to terrorist groups including Daesh (IS/ISIL). We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos.

While no videos or pictures have been made public yet, the world can only hope that Erdogan and company can make good on his words by publicly disclosing their alleged evidence.

Adding to the disclosure was Irans Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan:

The Western coalition is of a formal nature, they have no real intention to fight neither in Syria nor in Iraq. We dont see any readiness on their part to play a truly useful and meaningful role in fighting IS, because its them who have raised terrorists and they are interested in keeping them there. Maybe the coalition forces would like to see terrorists weakened, but certainly not destroyed, because those terrorists are their tool for destabilizing this region and some other parts of the world.

Of course, this statement is no longer just a theory or speculation, as U.S. House Representative from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that would stop the U.S. government from funding and supporting ISIL, both directly and indirectly. Tulsi stated a few things sure to get the attention of many:

If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Why does our gov get a free pass on this? The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its citizens. 

What is most interesting about Erdogans comments today then is the fact that he is calling out the U.S. government for funding and arming ISIL and other terrorists groups, when he has also been called out for doing the same. Remember from the paragraph above that Tulsi Gabbard said Turkey is one of the countries arming and funding ISIL. We must also remember when Vladimir Putin said the same thing in November of 2015.

So, perhaps Turkey (or certain aspects within the military and intelligence community within Turkey) have stopped coordinating with the CIA and other intelligence groups in helping to aid ISIL. Putin and Erdogan have made it no secret as to their willingness to collaborate more over the past several months. One of the biggest signals of this growing collaboration between Russia and Turkey was the signing of the Turkish Stream pipeline in late October. Additionally, Moscow announced today that they will be intensifying cooperation between Turkey, Iran and themselves within Syria. Maybe, just maybe, Turkey has broken ties with the Western banking/political cabal. Time will tell. 

It would make sense though in many ways if Turkey has broken off all or most ties with the Western cabal, as the world sees the writing on the wall for ISIL: Time is short.

Not only was ISIL defeated in Aleppo (the biggest battle to date), but they are being defeated in Mosul, Iraq. Today, Iraqs Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the world that ISIL would be defeated in Iraq within three months. 

Perhaps Turkey has made a full pivot East and is now working to defeat the terrorist group they were once arming and funding. Stranger things have happened. We watch in great anticipation as to what will happen next. ",1
"4","004.txt","Egyptian paper: Transcript proves Kerry plotted UN resolution against Israel with Palestinians  Report","On Tuesday, the Times of Israel reported that an Egyptian newspaper published what it called transcripts of meetings between top US officials  including Secretary of State John Kerry  and Palestinian officials that could, if true, prove Israels accusations that the Obama regime was behind the anti-Israel UN resolution approved by the Security Council.

According to the Times of Israel:

At the same time, a report in an Israeli daily Tuesday night pointed to Britain helping draft the resolution and high drama in the hours leading up to the vote, as Jerusalem tried to convince New Zealand to bury the Security Council measure.

In a meeting in early December with top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, US Secretary of State John Kerry told the Palestinians that the US was prepared to cooperate with the Palestinians at the Security council, Israels Channel 1 TV said, quoting the Egyptian Al-Youm Al-Sabea newspaper.

Also present at the meeting were US National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and Majed Faraj, director of the Palestinian Authoritys General Intelligence Service.

Kerry is quoted as saying that he could present his ideas for a final status solution if the Palestinians pledge they will support the proposed framework. The US officials advised the Palestinians to travel to Riyadh to present the plan to Saudi leaders.

According to the Times, the Egyptian report fits Israeli claims that it has ironclad proof the Obama regime helped craft the anti-settlement resolution.

We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage, said David Keyes, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Additionally, the Guardian said Israel may provide this information to the incoming Trump administration:

Doubling down on the claim a few hours later the controversial Israeli ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, went even further suggesting it had gathered evidence that it would present to the incoming Trump administration.

We will present this evidence to the new administration through the appropriate channels. If they want to share it with the American people, they are welcome to do it, Dermer told CNN.

According to Dermer, not only did the US not stand by Israels side during the vote, it was behind this ganging up on Israel at the UN.

Jeff Dunetz noted:

Israel fears that Kerry lays out his comprehensive vision for two-state solution and then turns it into another Security Council resolution imposing additional anti-Israel settlement terms on Israel, or at upcoming peace conference in Paris on Jan. 15 that Israel is not attending, all before the Israel-hating Obama leaves the White House three weeks from this coming Friday. Another possibility is the US recognizing a Palestinian State, any of the above eliminates the possibility of a negotiated solution.

The Egyptian report did not detail whose transcripts of the meeting it had obtained or how it had obtained them.

At the end of the meeting, the report said,  Rice and Kerry requested that the content of the discussion remain secret because of the sensitivity of the matter during the transition period in the U.S. The same way Kerry kept negotiations for the Iran deal secret from Israel until it was too late.

The Obama regime, however, has denied allegations that it was behind the resolution.

We did not draft this resolution; we did not introduce this resolution. We made this decision when it came up for a vote, Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday.",1

"6","006.txt","urkey President Claims Has Video Evidence Obama Is Supporting ISIS","President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is once again making accusations that the United States is directly supporting ISIS. Hes been mixed up in rumors of his supposed profiteering from the illicit ISIS oil trade in the past, so his accusations carry with them a need for healthy skepticism. Still, he is adamant in his allegations and says hes got irrefutable evidence.

His claims go beyond the single step of removal from direct involvement, our maintaining the implausible plausible deniability of aiding the so-called freedom fighters or rebels, the insulation the US has relied upon in arming, training and financing Obamas terrorist allies in the past. Its more than an acknowledgment of the rebranding of ISIS terrorists, our supposed enemy, as anonymous factions under the White House subversive.

Its beyond the contention of the Russians or the photographic evidence that John McCain was foolish enough to provide, what is basically little more than a choice in headscarf colors, the difference between their equivalent of the crips and the bloods, as being the legitimizing factor for aiding our terrorist enemies as the non-existent moderate freedom fighters.

Erdogan said in his Tuesday comments that he has confirmed evidence that US-led forces have supported ISIS. Erdogan stated in no uncertain terms that its very clear the US is supporting ISIS. He said, They were accusing us of supporting Daesh (ISIS). Now they give support to terrorist groups including Daesh, YPG, PYD. Its very clear. We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos. YPG and PYD are Kurdish groups that Erdogan regards as terrorists operating against Turkey.

Flanked by the visiting Guinean President Alpha Conde, Erdogan said, The coalition forces are unfortunately not keeping their promises. Whether they do or they dont, we will continue along this path in a determined way. There is no going back on the path we have set out on.

Erdogan complained They are supporting all the terror groups  the YPG, PYD but also including Daesh (ISIS)  Its quite clear, perfectly obvious, he said, adding that Turkey could provide proof in pictures and video. During a November visit to Pakistan Erdogan made similar claims, alleging the West stands by Daesh (ISIS) right now and its weapons were Western-made. At the time he declined to provide his evidence for inspection.

He needs to be more forthcoming this time around. If hes got the evidence, show it. Certainly none of us would be surprised to learn that Obama is behind ISIS, its already well known. We would like to put our hands on his proof, though, in order to properly charge Obama and convict him.",1
"7","007.txt","WHOA  Liberals Attacked Trump Inauguration Singer, But They Got KNOCKED OUT by America!","Finding a performer for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has not been easy, because many famous Liberals are still sitting up on their high horses.

Jackie Evancho, a teenage opera singer who got her start on Americas Got Talent, has agreed to sing the National Anthem for the inauguration. Many liberals have attacked her and her family, but proud Americans have supported her. Her music sales have quadrupled thanks to the American people! (via Breitbart)

Evanchos 2011 Dream With Me album and her 2010 O Holy Night are both sitting at No. 2 on the Billboard charts because of the American people and the pride they have in their country and this talented girl!

For her part, Jackie Evancho has expressed her excitement to sing at this event, which is a breath of fresh air compared to the other singers who have flat out refused to be a part of it, even though they were not even asked in the first place.

I have recently been asked by the President-elect to perform the National Anthem for the swearing-in ceremony at the inauguration, Evancho stated. Im so excited. Its going to be awesome. At least someone has some American pride.

But liberals, of course, arent about to hold back their disdain, even against a teenage girl. This is particularly ironic because of the details of Evanchos family.

My family is kind of a big target. I have a transgender sister and so a lot of hate goes towards us, Evancho claimed. But I also get a lot of love. So, we pay most attention to that. Sometimes we get really annoyed with the hate, everyone does, we have to admit it but we just ignore it.

So, Liberals are adding further hate directed at an innocent family who are trying to support their transgender member. I thought liberals were supportive of transgender people? Apparently they only care about the hate directed at them if the transgender person agrees with their political views.

At 16, Jackie Evanchos list of accomplishments already includes six studio albums. Her O Holy Night EP made her the youngest solo artist to reach platinum on the U.S. Billboard and also ranked her as the No. 1 Classical Albums Artist of 2011.

As one of the few people who are scheduled to perform for Donald Trumps inauguration, the young singer clearly has a ton of talent. The Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir also planned to perform for the incoming President.

Liberals are nothing but a bunch of sore losers, and the fact that they would harass a young girl because of her choice to perform is sickening. The truth is, Liberals will direct their hatred at anyone if they cant get their way.",1

"9","009.txt","REVEALED  Harry Reid Made a HUGE Mistake Right Before Leaving Congress, Its DEVASTATING","Once, Harry Reid pushed through the nuclear option to thwart the Republicans from representing their constituents. That very move is now coming back to haunt his Liberals peers just as Reid makes his long overdue exit from Congress.

He was warned that he and his fellow Democrats would one day regret this, but the arrogant Nevada Senators ignored the sound words of advice.That day has now arrived. The nuclear option will allow the Republican-controlled Senate to turn bills into law by a simple majority of 51 votes and not the super majority which requires 60 votes of approval, as Biz Pac Review notes.

Harry Reids nuclear option requiring only 51 votes to pass measures in the Senate coincided with exactly the number of seats Liberals held at the time. Now, the Republicans control both the House and Senate  which will allow them to easily pass all of the items President-Elect Donald Trumps agenda, if the career GOP politicians have the nerve, of course.

Should any GOP Senators jump ship and a rare tie occur in the Senate, Trumps agenda will still survive a nuclear option vote. Vice President-Elect Mike Pence holds the tie-breaking vote!

At least in public, Liberals are not willing to admit they are kicking themselves over following Harry Reids urgings on the nuclear option vote. At the time, Reid claimed the extreme rule change was necessary because the GOP was engaged in unprecedented obstruction.

Apparently saying NO! to  economically unfeasible Obama dictates is obstruction. The Republicans were following the Constitution and doing the job they were elected by We the People to do  which they can now do even more easily thanks to Harry Reid.

If Republicans want to go on record supporting radicals, thats their decision and they will have to live with it, Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Sen. Reid, said. If its radical to put Americans first, than so be it.

Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley claims he has absolutely no regret, over Reids nuclear option. Charles Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority Leader, doesnt appear to have been all that eager to accept the nuclear option.

Schumer reportedly wanted to keep the super majority vote threshold for both cabinet and Supreme Court appointments. Either his peers in the Senate did not share his concerns about the future when Republicans would be back in power, and felt Liberals would always be able to maintain a majority in the Senate, or were just too afraid of Harry Reid to vote against his plan.

One Liberal Senator, Richard Shelby from Alabama, tried to warn his fellow Democrats they were engaging in short term thinking when voting in favor of the nuclear option. They ignored his wise words as well, and totally ignored the big picture when placing their votes.

Democrats wont be in power in perpetuity. This is a mistake  a big one for the long run. Maybe not for the short run. Short-term gains, but I think it changes the Senate tremendously in a bad way, Senator Shelby said before the vote was taken in 2013.

Following both the text and the spirit of the Constitution while putting America and Americans first, would only be considered a radical concept by Liberals who have sipped far too much of the Kool-Aid handed out by the members of the politically correct far-left contingent in Washington.

Democrats will now be at the mercy of Donald Trump and the elected public servants across the aisle for at least the next four years and they have only themselves to blame!",1
"10","12.txt","BREAKING  Dems Caught Counting Hillary Votes 6 TIMES In THIS City, TIME FOR PRISON!","It turns out that the election may have been rigged after all. Its just that Hillary Clinton and her Democrats cant do any job right.

Entire precincts surrounding Detroit may be un-recountable, due to suspected voter fraud! Officials have found that, in hundreds of cases, the poll book numbers do not match the electronic voting machine printouts, as per The Detroit News.

Michigan state law holds that if a precinct is unable to be recounted, then the original count must stand.

Some of the problems may be due to biased elections staff. The machines used in Michigan, according to Detroit Elections Director Daniel Baxter, are quite old. In fact, 87 of the machines optical scanners broke on election day.

When there is such a problem with the machines, a ballot may get jammed in the scanner. The election staff then has to pull the ballot out and try again. This could result in a ballot being counted twice, or even six times, as the staff tries to get the ballot into the machine again and again.

The staff can manually erase the duplicate votes, but Baxter says that in many cases, [they] failed to do so. What, they forgot? Or perhaps they wanted to count the vote multiple times?

Of course, many of these precincts are strongly Democrat, at least according to historic voting trends. This includes Wayne County where Clinton received roughly two-thirds of the vote. If such widespread voter fraud has occurred, perhaps Michigan is a lot less blue than we thought.

There are other explanations for the vote discrepancies as well. As WND is reporting, Republican candidate Ken Crider has been keeping a close eye on his Districts elections process. Crider said, in a Facebook post, Pennys precinct, Detroit Precinct #152, had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper. The tag on the box said 306 and the book said 306 and the ticket said 306, so there should be 306 paper ballots on the box, right?

Well, when they pulled out the ballots, the stack seemed short, and when they finished separating the two page ballot to count the presidential page only, guess how many ballots were in the box? 304 no, 299 nope, 200 nada, how about 100 wrong again. There were only exactly 50 paper ballots in a locked sealed box that again was supposed to have 306. HMMMM. Crider is right to point out this mysterious circumstance.

If the seal was unbroken and there were no holes in the ballot box, then why was there an incorrect amount of ballots in there? It would be understandable to be off by one vote, but to be off by hundreds is highly suspicious and points, once again, to the election staff.

In my opinion, each of these staff members should be barred from working elections again. Whether through negligence or intention, something very bad has been going on here.

The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over 5,000 times.

The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio and others about the size of Donald Trumps hands.

Look at those hands, are they small hands? Trump told the audience at his rally in Detroit back in March. And he [Rubio] referred to my hands, if theyre small something else must be small. I guarantee you theres no problem, I guarantee it.

As Vanity Fairs Graydon Carter recalled online last year: Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a short-fingered vulgarian in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago.

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isnt surprised by Trumps actions.

Donald Trump is an ego-maniac, racist, bigot, who brings out the worst in the worst people, Bradley said. We get donations from poor people, the middle class and the upper class all the time. Since Donald Trump is the least charitable billionaire in the entire world, we expect no donations from that dick pic tweeting pervert anytime soon.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told reporters that he agrees with Trumps actions.

If everyone says you have a small penis, you dont keep it in your pants, you dont hide it; you prove them wrong! This is exactly what a real president should do! Praise Donald Trump! Praise Fappy!

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this about Donald Trump is accomplishing.

You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money.

"13","19.txt","Ted Cruz: I Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegal","WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this The single most important issue facing the country today and that without swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction.



Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because youve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. Im not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devils playground for good, Cruz said. Im asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think its safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.

Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.

Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isnt. To be honest, I dont know a lot about this subject matter. I dont need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and shes a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.

This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the states ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no Right to stimulate ones genitals. Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruzs former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruzs stance against stimulating ones own genitals was A new belief of his, implying that much of Cruzs time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruzs former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazins story.

All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldnt even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. Its absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching ones self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he cant do it anymore, then no one can.



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party.

It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President, Bradley said. With all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime. Bradley continued, Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.

Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devils doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, theyre big enough to handle it.

Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruzs call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban.

RNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a no-brainer and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.

Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the partys Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.

"14","2.txt","BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation, Pay to Play, Perjury","New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life, NYPD sources told True Pundit.

NYPD sources said Clintons crew also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders.

The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.

But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:

Money laundering
Child exploitation
Sex crimes with minors (children)
Perjury
Pay to play through Clinton Foundation
Obstruction of justice
Other felony crimes
NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the departments highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.

Whats in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach, the NYPD Chief said. There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.

The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.

People are going to prison, he said.

Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders  are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said.

If they dont cooperate they are going to see long sentences, a federal law enforcement source said.

NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said.

Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiners cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.

The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epsteins island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.

Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epsteins guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

Laptop Also Unveiled More Classified, Top Secret Breaches

According to other uncovered emails, Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiners unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D.C.

Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner.com. Weiner, a former seven-term Democratic Congressman from New York, primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City.

At one point, FBI sources said, Abedin and Clintons classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiners email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop.

However, Weiner and Abedin, who is Hillary Clintons closest personal aide, werent the only people with access to the Weiners email account. Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to Abedins sensitive State Department emails that were stored in Weiners email account, FBI sources confirmed.

FEC records show Weiner paid more than $92,000 of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site. According to FBI sources, the D.C.-based political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweiner.com domain since 2010, the same time Abedin was working at the State Department. This means technically Weiner and Abedins emails, including top secret State Department emails, could have been accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed, FBI sources said.

According to FBI sources, the bureaus newly-minted probe into Clintons use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state, has also been broadened to include investigating new email-related revelations, including:

Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiners email
Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails.
Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records
Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents
A private consultant managed Weiners site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domains listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts.
Because Weiners campaign website is managed by the third-party consultant and political email guru, FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to Weiners server and emails and who were these people. Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers, or other actors.

Abedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didnt know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept. of State system. Instead, she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo, Clintonemail.com and her email linked to Weiner.

Abedin said, according to FBI documents, she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept. and print the documents, many of which were classified and top secret, from the largely unprotected webmail portals.

Clinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept. so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her, Abedin said. Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept. fax machine installed in her Chappaqua, NY home without assistance.

Perhaps more alarming, according to the FBIs 302 Report detailing its interview with Abedin, none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner. There was never a follow up, according to the 302 report.

But now, all that has changed, with the FBIs decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptops emails.",1

Clinton, who has deep ties to Soros, also wore purple during her concession speech on Nov. 9.
Soros, a socialist billionaire best known for breaking the British pound in 1992, has funded government overthrows, known as color revolutions, in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries in the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and North Africa.
And now hes trying to do the same using far-left radicals in the U.S., if Hillarys recent penchant for the color purple is any indication.
But why purple? Its the color resulting from mixing red and blue  and Clinton and others pushing the upcoming purple revolution will likely justify it as the unification of the divided red and blue states of America.
Anytime globalist politicians embrace a color, be on guard for a revolution bearing that particular hue, reported D.C. journalist Wayne Madsen. On the day after the election that propelled Donald Trump into the White House, Hillary and Bill Clinton entered the ballroom of the Moonie Unification Church-owned New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhattan adorned in the color purple.
Mrs. Clinton wore a pant suit with purple lapels and a purple blouse, while Bill Clinton wore a purple tie.
Already many of the nationwide protests since the election were coordinated by the Soros-funded activist group MoveOn.org.

Coming on the heels of the Conservative Political Action Conference held at Marylands National Harbor, President Obama announced his decision to temporarily end presidential term limits, saying, Im not seeing any potential presidential candidates on either side of the aisle who are capable of carrying out the task of running the country.

Citing poor performance on the part of a Republican-controlled congress, the struggling economy, and the continuing situation with ISIS, Obama said he feels obligated to continue his term in order to steer the country away from crisis just like Roosevelt.

This is not something out of the ordinary, says political analyst Elliot Stabler. We already have several states with no gubernatorial term limits. Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, New York, just to name a few. In fact Michael Bloomberg repealed term limits in order to run for a third time as New York City mayor.

In addition Mr. Obama has ordered the National Guard to remain on standby in the months leading up to and during his third term. He will issue a second executive order authorizing the Department of Justice to temporarily suspend Habeas Corpus in the event a state of emergency is declared due to opposition to his decision to continue the presidency.

The Twenty-second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified on February 27th, 1951 and sets a limit of two four-year terms for the office of the President of the United States.

If we continue traveling at our current trajectory, we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country, warned Dr. Emilio Martinez. Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten-year period. What weve seen is an incremental increase of twenty-three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border.

The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over 345 million people by 2025. However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesnt factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. Our models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by 2025 will reach approximately 621 million with just under forty-nine per cent consisting of American citizens, Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a 2% margin of error.

In contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about 126.3 million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the countrys ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. Mexicans -as weve seen over the last quarter century  have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada, said Luis Garcia, a third-year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. These numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades.

Garcias data shows that by 2050, a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below 2.5 million. These people arent simply disappearing, said Garcia. On the contrary, theyre coming to the United States.",1

Were doing something thats never been done before, Zuckerberg declared. By allowing Americans to utilize Facebook to cast their vote in the upcoming presidential election from anywhere in the world using their desktop or mobile devices, were eliminating the conditions for which voter suppression can be implemented.

In the days leading up to the presidential election, Facebook users will be able to log into their accounts and find the profiles of each candidate prominently displayed at the top of their News Feed. Users can then cast their vote by Liking their desired candidates profile, Zuckerberg explained before adding, Its that simple.

Kathryn Blair, a senior official with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission  the federal agency which oversees state and national elections  said that Facebooks revolutionary new voting platform is projected to become a national standard by 2020. We aim to completely phase out the old-style paper ballots by 2018, Blair told CNNs Wolf Blitzer. In a very short time, all elections in the United States will be decided through Facebook. Ms. Blair later said the EAC is working with Facebook to reduce voter fraud by identifying and eliminating duplicate or otherwise fake accounts.

According to Zuckerberg, the upcoming U.S. presidential election is only the beginning for Facebooks innovative voting platform. In the not too distant future, Facebook will determine the outcome of elections all around the world. From the United Kingdom to Pakistan; to Ukraine, the Philippines and Israel, vowed Zuckerberg. Wherever democracy thrives, Facebook will be there.",1

Dubbed Steven the Great by Mr. Putin, the sixty-four year-old Under Siege star will take up residence at the Grand Livadia Palace in the coastal city of Yalta where he will hold power over nearly two million Crimeans. Featuring a breathtaking panoramic view of the Black Sea, the royal residence once served as a summer retreat for Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia.

This is a momentous day, not just for the people of Crimea, but for all Russians, proclaimed Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev during an appearance on the state-run news network Russia Today. Steven the Great is a legendary martial artist with an extensive background in firearms and marksmanship. Furthermore, he is more proficient and possesses far greater experience in hand-to-hand combat, counter-terrorism operations, and crime fighting than any man on earth excluding His Excellency President Putin.

The prime minister later said Putin has the utmost confidence in Seagals ability to rule Crimea, calling the star of Hard to Kill a firm but gentle leader who is well versed in the art of paternalism. To drive the point home, Putin will hand over command of Russian forces in Crimea  including the Black Sea Fleet based in Sevastopol  to Mr. Seagal upon his arrival at Livadia Palace later this week.

Steven Seagal, who has appeared in a number of martial arts-style action films including Above the Law, On Deadly Ground, and Exit Wounds, was awarded Russian citizenship last Thursday by President Vladimir Putin, who issued a special decree honoring the actor.

(AP)  Following the results of Tuesday nights election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.

People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers, Obama told reporters. Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.

Under the Presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.

Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidents decision.

Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnt allow that to happen. President Obama doesnt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.

The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college.

We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.

Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election.

Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their states electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.

Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidents Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether.

[The electoral college] is a fking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and thats just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Its time to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.

Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward.

Were going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this, Obama said. Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this? Obama said. If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.

Scientists and academics alike have already voiced concerns that Sarah Palins strong disbelief in climate change could have dramatic consequences for the planet.
God killed the dinosaurs

Some scientists openly fear that Sarah Palin could be the end of the science establishment as we know it and would relegate the Office of Science and Technology to the dark ages.

I mean, this is scary as hell explains climatologist Dan B. Evans from the University of California, Berkeley.

The woman claimed in an interview in 2009 that God killed the dinosaurs and that he had sent the flood to purge the dinosaurs off of the earth, he warned, visibly concerned.

With Sarah Palin as director of the Office of Science and Technology, we are definitely stepping into la-la land he adds.

A scientific community in disbelief

Sarah Palins strong stance against climate change in the past has earned her an army of detractors, especially within environmentalist circles.

In a 2009 UN statement that acknowledged that 97% of climate experts agree humans are causing global warming, Sarah Palin responded, the documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowd and called the 2007 IPCC report a load of rubbish and a fraud.

With irresponsible leaders such as Trump and Palin in the White House, polar ice cap melting will increase dramatically and waters could rise an easy 33% in the next ten years has even admitted James Hillocks, a top Greenpeace climate scientist.

Environmentalists fear the worst as President-elect Donald Trump has already threatened to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Pact, potentially dealing a death blow to the whole accord by refuting the international consensus on climate change, believe experts.",1

Yoko Ono when asked about her thoughts about Hillarys run for the presidency completely took reporters by surprise.

"28","5.txt","Another Person Investigating The Clintons Turns Up Dead","Today, a young woman working for an anti-child trafficking organization was laid to rest.  Her name was Monica Petersen, and she turned up dead in Haiti on Sunday after posting I Found A Smoking Gun on social media.  Her friends and family are calling foul as her family cannot get believable information from Haitian authorities, and Ms. Petersen just happened to publicly post some reports that implicate the Clintons involvement in alleged human trafficking via a mine run by Hillary Clintons brother Tony Rodham.

A compilation of the various threads from reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Imgur and more can be found on the Reddit The Donald page here.


Go figure.  Just like any number of people either close to the Clintons or investigating them who could possibly end up a material witness during a trial, Ms. Petersen ends up dead.  This, for those following the fake news propaganda coming out of globalists, leftists, and the disgraced legacy media, is why there is a Clinton Body Count.  Monica Petersens name may well be added to it.


According to several reports, Haiti has been a nexus for child trafficking for a number of years.  In fact, found in the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from John Podestas email account, information surfaced that Hillary Clinton assisted a Haitian woman, Laura Silsby, known to be involved in child trafficking in 2010 when she was caught trying to take 33 children  not orphans  out of Haiti.  The two womens history is known to reach back at least fifteen years.  Also in the Podesta emails are several archaic conversations about pizza that have taken on the aura of internet lore (what some call conspiracy theories) known as #pizzagate, and reportedly is the tip of the iceberg in an international child trafficking ring.

The rabbit hole gets very deep when one considers how many times Bill Clinton is known to have traveled Jeffrey Epsteins private child molestation island.

Did Monica Petersen get too close? A tenacious young woman investigating one of the most egregious crimes any human can commit, if she got too close to the criminal element and was known to them, it is a definite possibility.  A good friend of hers named Bella claims she found out what happened and is refusing to elaborate on public next-pagemessaging boards.  Whatever the case is, the people around the Clintons and those investigating them sure do tend to end up dead.",1
"29","51.txt","OTTOMANS WERE THE FIRST TO REACH THE MOON, SAYS TURKISH PRESIDENT","Istanbul| Ottomans were the first to walk on the surface of the moon, not Neil Armstrong, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, yesterday, during an iftar (fast-breaking) dinner hosted by the Turkish Green Crescent.

Mr. Erdogan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than 300 years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque in the crater where they landed.

It is alleged that the first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969, Erdogan said. In fact, Muslim space explorers reached our satellite 334 years before that, in 1635. Everyone knows the story of the famous aviator, Lagâri Hasan Çelebi, the Ottoman Rocket Man, who made the first successful manned rocket flight in 1633. What you might not know, is that he attempted to reach the moon, two years later, and could very well have succeeded!

The story of Lagari Hasan Çelebi was purported by a famous 17th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya Çelebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan Çelebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5 kg or 140 lbs) of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.

As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launch O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!, before lighting the rockets gunpowder.  He then ascended more than 200 meters in the air and landed in the sea, hundreds of meters from his takeoff point. Swimming ashore, he allegedly reported: O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!.

This 17th-century engraving depicts one of Lagâri Hasan Çelebis famous rocket flights, but its unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in 1635.
President Erdogans surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims.

Why do you not believe it? Because youve never believed that a Muslim can do such a thing, just like youve never believed that our ancestors could manage to launch ships in the Golden Horn after transporting them across land, Erdogan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet IIs conquest of Istanbul in 1453. This claim is not new. A number of academics in Turkey and in the rest of the world have made this claim, and I believe they are right. NASA may have destroyed most of the physical evidence of the Ottomans success during the Apollo 11 mission, but well try to find any evidence that might have escaped the cover up.

The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them.

ottoman
The description of the flying engine used by Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is pretty vague and doesnt really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate.
The story of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the aviator could have survived a flight into outer space.

His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode Crash and Burn.  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya Çelebis descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period;

The team noted that Evliya Çelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagâri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been extremely difficult for a 17th-century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight",1

Posing as representatives from the Nationalist Reform Council  a fictional conservative action group  ACORN officials staged several mock elections last month at community centers throughout Cullman County, Alabama, under the pretense of helping residents register to vote in time for the general election. We were really pleased with the turnout, said Matthew Breyer, who heads ACORNs northern Alabama office. We were able to register nearly twenty thousand voters over the span of three days.

Once residents were successfully registered to vote, ACORN officials ushered them into a room where about a dozen voting booths had been set up. We wanted to get an idea of the average voters understanding of the election process, Breyer said before adding that voters were asked to enter a booth and cast their vote for the candidate of their choice. However, unbeknownst to participants, the ballots had been slightly altered. Under the category U.S. President/U.S. Vice President, you had the option for Clinton/Kaine centered inside a solid red rectangle, Breyer explained. Likewise, the option for Trump/Pence was centered inside a solid blue rectangle.

Following the simulations conclusion, ACORN officials were amazed to discover that more than two-thirds of registered Republicans in Cullman County who participated in the mock election had cast their votes in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She won by a massive landslide, recalled Breyer. The data we collected seems to suggest that a sizable number of Republican voters are unable to read above a third grade level and are simply casting votes by selecting the color that corresponds with their preferred party.

This should be a major wake up call and I think we need to take a hard look at the educational system in this country, said Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Barry King. This may have been a simulation but weve got multiple GOP leaders saying theres going to be a rigged election next month.

Trump received backlash from Democrats and members of the intelligence community on Thursday when it came to light that he engaged in a ninety-minute Skype video session last weekend with North Koreas Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Trump described the unprecedented discussion  which critics have called a clear violation of U.S. protocol  as extraordinary, saying the North Korean dictator appeared to be in very good health.

We had a wonderful conversation, the former reality TV star said of Kim. Hes very different from the way hes portrayed by the media and, you know, thats something I can relate to. Trump said he was surprised by exactly how much he and the Supreme Leader have in common. We both love meatloaf, Trump exclaimed. He said he eats it all the time. I said You ought to come to New York, Ill give you the best meatloaf youve ever had in your life.

Aside from sharing a love of baked ground meat, Trump and his North Korean counterpart discussed a wide range of issues including the economy, nuclear proliferation, and the reunification of North and South Korea. Trump, who repeatedly made the assertion during his campaign that more countries should have nuclear weapons, said he was willing to look into the possibility of loosening certain sanctions against the North Korean regime that might hinder the progress of its nuclear program. If they had that nuclear threat, Im sure it would be very good thing in terms of helping to unify the Korean peninsula, the president-elect said.

For his part, Mr. Trump said he offered praise for North Koreas single-party political system. I told him it was a very impressive thing to have such a successful political party that has lasted so long in that country. During his nearly two-hour long conversation with the Supreme Leader, Mr. Trump expressed an interest in implementing a similar single-party system in the United States as part of his effort to unite the country. I think it would be very good thing to have, said Trump, adding, Youd see a change in this country like you wouldnt believe.

Vice president-elect Mike Pence, who heads Trumps transition team, described the ninety-minute Skype session as very casual, telling The New York Times that its not unusual for world leaders to reach out following an election. This was the elected leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea  a democracy very similar to ours  offering his congratulations and good wishes, the vice president-elect explained.

Of course it isnt. It was coerced under the threat of violence, and no court in the nation would uphold the contract as legally binding.

Yet right now, electoral voters all across America are being essentially held at gunpoint, threatened with being killed if they dont change their votes to oppose Donald Trump. The dishonest mainstream media is further amplifying the coercion by running an organized psyop campaign of disinfo (psyop means psychological operations) which falsely claims the Russians hacked the election, despite the complete absence of a shred of evidence to support the narrative.

The Russian hack conspiracy delusion has already been completely discredited. It turns out the DNC emails were leaked by a democrat insider who supported Bernie Sanders. The handing over of the emails took place in a wooded area in Washington D.C. and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russians.

Electors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails, phone calls and letters  and even death threats  in an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday, reports the NY Post today.

The NY Post also reports:

Reports of GOP electors being badgered have been reported in numerous states, including Georgia, Idaho, Tennessee, Arizona, Utah and Michigan.

For Michael Banerian, a senior at Oakland University in Michigan and a Republican elector, the harassment comes with a dark side.

He said hes been getting death threats via email, snail mail, Twitter and Facebook.

Somebody threatened to put a bullet in the back of my mouth, Banerian, 22, told The Post on Wednesday.

Leftists are kidnapping electoral voters and holding them for ransom

What you may not know is that these death threats are a coordinated campaign to threaten electoral voters into throwing the election. Yet the very existence of such persistent, coordinated death threats means that We the People must correct the electoral votes, knowing that many such votes will be cast under the threat of being killed. Thus, electoral votes cast under threat or violence are not legally binding. They may be reclaimed by the courts and corrected to represent the will of the voters in their states.

In essence, the political left  organized by international terrorist money man George Soros and people with ties to both the White House and Hillary Clinton  has psychologically kidnapped the electoral voters, and theyre demanding a kind of ransom or they will be killed. That ransom is a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump.

In other words, this is a political mugging where the radical left is holding a gun to their heads and saying, Your vote or your life.

And if they manage to switch 37 electoral votes through such death threats, the left will declare a victory for America, proclaiming the very people they threatened with being killed as being heroes for saving the country.

Unbelievable, isnt it? This is right out of the Kim Jong-Un playbook for how to run a brutal dictatorship, which is probably why the radical left loves it so much. If you do what they want, youre heralded as a national hero. If you dont do what they want, you get a bullet in the head.

This really is the way liberals exert power, by the way, which is precisely why the DNC leaks happened in the first place: Some Bernie Sanders supporters were so angry at the Clinton collusion and corruption, they decided to expose the DNC by handing over leaked emails to Wikileaks. The democrats only have themselves to blame for losing the election because the truth came out.

Lawless democrats have no respect for real democracy theyre pushing America toward a civil war they will quickly lose

What these tactics reveal is how lawless democrats have no respect whatsoever for the laws of this nation. Acting as crybullies and domestic terrorists, if they dont get their way, they threaten to shoot everybody who disagrees with them. (Sound familiar? Look up the history of Chinas Cultural Revolution.)

Thats the kind of behavior we see from totalitarian dictators in places like Cuba, North Korea or Communist China. And its perfectly aligned with the tyrannical philosophy of the political left: If they dont get their way, they threaten to kill everyone who opposes them.

Ive got news for those who espouse such threats of violence, coercion and lawlessness: We the People will stop you by invoking the Second Amendment to protect the Republic. And after we stop you, we will imprison you and charge you with crimes of treason. From there, the courts can decide what punishment is appropriate for your crimes.

Once President Trump is sworn into office, I hope he unleashes a massive investigation into all those who made death threats against the electoral voters. Those individuals must be arrested, imprisoned and charged with serious felony crimes, including sedition. Putting a gun to the heads of electoral voters is a very serious thing. It threatens the sanctity of the entire Republic. Such threats cannot go unpunished.

Hey, we can finally put all those FEMA camps to good use!

In observing all this, Ive come to realize the radical left is going to push America into a civil war. But I also believe a civil war wont last very long because the left will be very quickly defeated by a combination of police, military and armed American patriots fighting alongside law enforcement.

It turns out all those FEMA camps will come in handy after all: Thats where we can put all the left-wing terrorists and traitors who tried (but failed) to overthrow the country. There, well pump in broadcasts of Sean Hannity and Michael Savage until we break the NLP hypnosis programming the left-wingers have been subjected to for the last eight years under Obama, a master of linguistic subterfuge.

Over time, some of them might be rehabilitated to the point where they can rejoin society as sane, rational citizens instead of the mentally ill crybullies they are today. After all, we want to help these people heal their mental illness wherever possible. Unlike the radical left which wants to kill everyone they dont agree with, conservative Americans are far more interested in saving lives and uplifting our fellow brothers and sisters, no matter what sort of psychological trauma they were subjected to by CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times.

Remember: The same kind of psyop the media is running right now against the electoral voters has been pursued for years against liberals and progressives. Thats why they are so traumatized by reality: Theyve been poisoned, programmed, hypnotized and traumatized by the left-wing media for as long as they can remember!

Its time to finally set all Americans free from the psychological prisons that have been built for them by the corrupt political left. That effort begins anew on January 20, 2017, which is precisely why the radical left is planning to stage a mass uprising on that day. They last thing the left wants is Americans who arent subjected to a daily dose of left-wing propaganda.

The sight of the C-130 search-and-rescue aircraft and two HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters making passes over the heart of no-fly Manhattan for 40 minutes Tuesday, without warning or explanation, unnerved countless New Yorkers and tourists, many of whom took to Twitter and Facebook expressing post-9/11 concerns.

Sources told On the Inside that the flyovers were part of an emergency relocation drill designed to identify locations, primarily in Central Park, where a chopper could touch down near Trumps home inside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, and safely evacuate Trump and others from the city.  READ MORE",1

After divorcing from his first wife, Barbara Mikkelson, David Mikkelson married Elyssa Young, a former porn star and current escort who now works for Snopes as an administrator, according to the Daily Mail.

The Daily Mail also revealed that top Snopes fact-checker Kim LaCapria claimed on her personal blog that she has posted to Snopes after smoking marijuana. As TheDC previously revealed, LaCapria describes herself as openly left-leaning and once claimed that Republicans fear female agency. (RELATED: Fact-Checking Snopes: Websites Political Fact-Checker Is Just A Failed Liberal Blogger)

Shes convinced that, sooner than later, the voters will come to their senses and realize they made a horrible mistake by putting [Donald] Trump in the White House, a source close to Hillary told Ed Klein Confidential. Shes sure the voters will beg her to get in the race and she says, Im going to run again in 2020.

Not all her advisers agree. In fact, several of them believe Hillary is in a bad waydeeply depressed, drinking too much, and delusional about her chances of making a successful run for the White House four years from now when shell be 73 and in shaky health.

But these advisers are afraid to dash Hillarys presidential dreams and send her into an even deeper depression.

Hillary is in a state of denial and accepts zero responsibility for her loss to Trump, one of these sources said. Shes convinced that [FBI Director James] Comeys last-minute announcement that he was reopening his investigation of Hillarys emails was planned in advance by her Republican enemies. Shes also convinced that [Russian president Vladimir] Putin was working with Trump and that the two were in direct contact.

She further believes that a groundswell of anger is going to make it impossible for Trump to govern effectively, the source continued. In her view, Trump is a rank amateur in the art of politics, and hes going to screw up badly and find himself in deep trouble.

She told meand Im paraphrasing: Trump has no idea what its like to run the biggest corporation in the world, the United States government. He has no fg idea how complicated it is, how many cogs are spinning at the same time, how many people are fighting at cross purposes, how much disinformation you get.

"40","67.txt","Heading out the door, Obama bans offshore drilling in Atlantic, Arctic Oceans","Trump might be able to reverse it, but its tricky.

Hes only got a few weeks left to damage Americas energy independence. Obama needs to work fast, and he is. Ever the creative one, Obama has found a way to twist the original intent of a law passed in 1953 to enact bans on offshore drilling in massive sections of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The law was never intended to facilitate any such action, as The Hill explains, but since when does Obama consider himself constrained by the law?

Obama will use a section of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to implement the protections, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the plans.

Its unclear, however, how large Obamas protected areas will be.

The action would answer calls from environmentalists to implement so-called 12(a) protections in the Atlantic and Arctic as a more lasting legacy against fossil fuels from Obama.

Obama last month made final a plan for offshore drilling lease sales from 2017 to 2022 that excludes the Atlantic and Arctic.

But that plans time period is limited, and President-elect Donald Trump can revise the plan to insert lease sales if he wishes.

Previous presidents have used the 1953 law rarely. In each case, they focused on small areas of water and set time limits in an effort to protect particular species.

Its unclear how easily Trump can undo the protections, since no previous president has tried to roll back a predecessors actions under that law. Congress may also step in to undo Obamas actions.

This is a classic act of recklessness on Obamas part  applying a law beyond all recognition of its original intent, and telling American oil companies they cant explore gigantic portions of the world. Just because hes Barack Obama and he hates fossil fuels. He also leave a mess for Donald Trump to try to clean up, if he can.

Can he?

Maybe. The most effective way for Trump to reverse Obamas heading-out-the-door finger in the eye to Americas oil industry, if not necessarily the simplest, would be to ask Congress to make an amendment to the law, essentially nullifying Obamas actions. He could also amend Obamas drilling lease plan for the period of 2017-2022 by adding more leases, conceivably in the areas of the Atlantic and Arctic where Obama is trying to ban them.

What Trump might try to do instead is simply declare that Obamas action under the law is null and void at the executive level, and substitute his own. Its not clear how much force of law Obamas action has, although its not purely an executive order because he did take the action under an existing statute  albeit very far afield from the original intent of the statute.

I suspect that if Trump simply tries to reverse Obamas actions unilaterally, there will be political resistance but no real constituency with an avenue to effectively prevent Trumps action.

There is some luxury of time here, because at the moment most American oil companies who engage in offshore drilling do so almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore drilling in the Pacific has also been made very difficult by political resistance, and that could also be a challenge for Trumps new EPA.

In the meantime, Obama shows us once again that his priority above all else is the service of a left-wing ideological agenda. If he wanted to enact this ban at any point during his presidency, he could have done so and dealt with the political blowback. Instead, he waited until the final weeks of his presidency so he could lay this trap for his successor, and for the nation, to deal with.

As relieved as we are that we will never have to talk about President Hillary, the end of President Obama cant come soon enough either.",1
"41","68.txt","Escaped ISIS Sex Slave Goes Before Congress, DESTROYS Obama With 1 Devastating Sentence","A woman who knows first-hand the brutality of ISIS testified before Congress not too long ago, and she had some pretty damning words for outgoing President Obama.

The USA must act. We must terminate DAESH [Islamic State] and all such terror, former ISIS sex slave Nadia Murad said through a translator.


Murad, who escaped captivity in 2014, also spoke out on the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando that killed 49 Americans. She said she wasnt surprised.

I knew if ISIS were not stopped, they would spread their crimes everywhere.

And just like a cancer that continues to metastasize and slowly eat away at a persons insides, her self-fulfilling prophecy has come true in more ways than one.

Obama is just like an inept doctor in that regard, and Murad called him out on it:

If a country as strong as your country cannot protect its citizens in Orlando, or in Belgium or in France, how come a small minority like us can protect ourselves while we are in the heart of the land where radicals are? Murad said bravely.

Well, Ms. Murad, it might have something to do with the fact we are knee-deep in the bull pen called political correctness. Obamas decision not to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name and his choice to redact the original 9-1-1 transcript from the Pulse gunman bore witness to that fact back in June.

And where was the outrage after the Pulse massacre when the 2013 FBI investigation into the gunman was dropped due to concerns of Islamophobia? Where is the outrage now that 12 people in Berlin are dead and their families devastated? Wheres the outrage that Russia has responded appropriately while we are still sitting on our butts? Dont we realize President Obama could have prevented all of this a long time ago?

Ill bet Nadia Murad does. Our president should have lost his right to govern for not responding effectively to this threat. He and his liberal brethren just call people on the other side of the aisle racist and allow the bodies to continue to pile up due to their inept leadership.

Peter Soeller, a New York City student and civil rights activist, tweeted that he and approximately 20 of his pals were attacked by Donald Trump supporters after they left a party on Saturday night, BizPac Review reports. According to Soeller, his buddies were merely walking down the street chanting and laughing when four or five Trump supporters suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

The Trump supporters confronted us and assaulted us yelling, Blue Lives Matter Get out of my country, calling us faggots and commies as they wailed on us, Soeller tweeted. So, there were 20 millennials on their way home from a Black Lives Matter party and not a single one of them had a cellphone to whip out and take a few seconds of video of the alleged beating?

Millennials are rarely ever separated from their phonesdoing so could lead to them missing the chance for yet another inane selfie. It is beyond illogical to think 20 college kids would leave for a night out and not one of them had a working phone.

Soeller and his friends were on their way home from the Decolonize This Place party when they were allegedly stopped by a small handful of Trump supporters. Soeller claims he and two others were the most seriously injured.

No more pettiness, time to organize, Soeller also said in his tweet. He claimed the roving mini horde of Trump supporters were trolling the streets looking for queer anti-Trump activists.

The anti-police activist also made a baseless claim about the four or five attackers who supposedly beat up the 20 millennials. Soeller claimed the Trump supporters were off-duty cops.

Why did Soeller leap to such a wild accusation? The build of the attackers and the way they took us down, convinced the college student the unknown men had to be police officers.

Trump supporter attack stories appear to be all the rage since the election. The elusive Trump fans wander around city streets in search of millennials to whomp on  at least that is what the snowflakes claim.

One such story has already been debunked. A Muslim college student who claimed she was attacked by Trump supporters who hurled Islamic slurs at her was actually just trying to stay out of trouble with her strict parents.

The Muslim girl had stayed out too late in the evening with her boyfriend and needed a sympathetic story to tell the folks. She went into great detail when describing the alleged attack to police officers, who quickly realized far too many holes existed in her tall tale.

Well just have to wait and see if such holes start piling up in this case. Im sure the involved police officers will be paying extra close attention in the case of this cop-hating agitator and his 20 friends, who couldnt take on four or five cop built guys.

He points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of 2015, with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since. Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business.

In an interview Obama was asked, Mr. president, when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State? Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.

Mr. Dobbs points out the fact that Everybody else, however, didnt believe the president when he said that. And Clintons top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, We need to clean this up, noting the president has emails from Hillary that do not say State.gov.'

Dobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress. In that instance Podesta cities executive privilege. Dobbs points out that March was also when the firm managing her server, Platte River Networks, deleted her email archive using Bleachbit, despite that subpoena.

March was also the month that Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe suggested that the wife of a strategically placed FBI official run for the Virginia State Senate. He also donated $467,000 to her campaign and then promoted him to the number two position in the FBI, in charge of the Clinton investigation.

"44","70.txt","Dear Media LIARS: Heres Who Is REALLY Responsible For Berlin Terror Attack","The Berlin attack is opening peoples eyes to the situation at hand, and they are blaming terrorist organizations like ISIS, but theyre not the only ones facing peoples wrath.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing huge backlash in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that killed 12 peoplebecause of her open immigration policies, as per The Sun.

Many people are saying it is because of her that this attack took place, because of her sympathy for Muslim refugees seeking asylum in any country that will take them.

But theres one problem with these refugeeswherever they go, attacks, murders, and rapes are increasing. Anywhere where these migrants are, violence follows.

Its not looking good for the chancellor, who is up for reelection soon. She may not even get a chance to do so with so many of the German people calling for her blood. Many are blaming her for these deaths of innocent people.

These are Merkels dead, said Marcus Pretzell, chairman of the Alternative for Germany party in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Klaus Bouillon of Merkels CDU party also said to Saarland radio: We must state that we are in a state of war, although some people who want to see only the good cannot see.

Merkel was attending the ironically named International Day of Migrants when the attack took place, and she stated she was shocked and shaken by the tragedy that had taken place. Merkel can pretty much kiss her career goodbye.

The German people are no longer as sympathetic to immigrants as some German politicians, due to the increase in assaults they are witnessing. Similar incidents have taken place in Ansbach, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, and Bielefeld.

Merkels opponents are sure to be gaining more popularity as more are leaning towards the right and calling for these refugees to be booted out of the country. Many European countries are regretting their decisions to let these migrants into their countries.

This is why so many are intolerant of the Islamic faith and having these immigrants in their countriesviolence seems to follow them everywhere they go since for every three or four peaceful Muslims, there is one bent on destruction. Many other countries, including America, have seen increased attacks stemming from these migrants.

They all need to go back to their own countries, plain and simple. Its like being in a destructive relationshiptheyre already going to tear themselves down, but if you cut-sling, you dont have to go down with them. And the American people are not going down with them.

And Im sure that the German people dont want to go down either. Merkel is sure to not be elected next year for her fourth term as chancellor, especially with Pretzell laying the blame at her feet. Its time to cease the sympathy for Muslim migrants, because its only hurting the countries that take them in.",1

Hillarys husband and the rest of the Democrats are pointing fingers everywhere except for at Hillary Clinton, who deserves it.

The fact of the matter is that she ran a terrible campaign, and thats why she lost. You would think she would have done so much better, due to the fact that this wasnt her first rodeo, but it bombed. It was DOA. Dead. On. Arrival.

Regarding Bills statement that Trump called him after the election, Trump clarified that it was Bill Clinton who called him and offered a very nice congratulations. Donald Trump was elected because he ran a very successful, if unconventional, campaign.

It was because of its unconventionality that it was so successful. The Trump campaign was a breath of fresh air to the American people, who were tired of the same old rickety career politicians who are dusted off and paraded around for the people to see.

Hillarys campaign did focus on the wrong states and barely made any appearances. Donald Trump hopped from state to state, practically killing himself to make several appearances and running himself ragged to prove to the people he was their best choice.

She failed to focus on states like Arkansas and states in the Midwest. She probably viewed them as beneath her and not worth her precious time. She was so sure that she was going to win that she didnt even bother trying to sell herself in enough states.

The Clintons lost because of her and her campaigns mistakes, but who do they blame? They blame people like FBI Director Comey for reopening the investigation into Hillarys email scandal 11 days before the election, which did hurt her numbers.

But frankly, if youre going to complain about that, then try not performing illicit actions with government property and maybe you wont be in the situation in the first place. Its as simple as that, but the Democrats refuse to not think of themselves as victims.

Donald Trumps response to Bill Clinton was absolutely perfect, and even more so because he put it on Twitter and sent it directly to the American people. Trump doesnt wait for the mainstream media to twist his wordshe delivers them himself.

Trump is our president-elect, and he was confirmed as the next president by the Electoral College on Monday. So, all the effort that liberals put forth to prevent this was for nothingthey have, once again, failed. They can point fingers all they want and play the blame game, but it wont change the outcome that Trump is the president, and Hillary Clinton is not.",1

"48","74.txt","BREAKING  Rand Paul Stands Up For TRUMP, Says What All Of Us Were Thinking","The 2016 GOP nominating was definitely a slugfest. While Rand Paul would have made a decent nominee, he came out in support of a major policy of the man whos been called upon to lead our nation.

Lets not give in to Washington and its stagnated ways. Lets follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Bush and help President Trump begin his administration with tax cuts for everyone and less money in Washington, Paul wrote in an op-ed for Breitbart.

We have tried it before, Paul wrote. In fact, the most successful Republican presidents (and a few Democrats) led off their agendas with tax cuts to send money back and to try to get government to live with a little less. 

Indeed, there have been two men who have shown how well tax cuts can play a role in stimulating our economy. These men were Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.

When we elected the youthful Kennedy to become our 35th president, he had little economic experience, and the nation was still in the doldrums of a recession in 1958 that rivaled the one of 2008. He set out to determine how to get the country back on track.

As Lawrence Kudlow and Brian Domitrovic wrote in Time, in Kennedys first year in office, he at first tried the typical Democrat approach and instilled a number of spending approaches. However, growth was only at a stagnant 2.7 percent. He then had a change of heart and decided to push through a generous tax cut of 30 percent. 

Although Kennedy never saw it to fruition before he was assassinated, LBJ decided to push it through as a memorial to the fallen leader. The tax cut became law in 1964, and it started an uninterrupted run of eight years of consistent economic growth of at least five percent annually.

One of Kennedys other successors was a man named Ronald Reagan, who was intrigued by the Kennedy model of tax cuts. He devised his own plan, and it passed the Senate by a 97-3 vote in 1986. The nation enjoyed a long-term growth rate of roughly four percent per year.

In 2016, the economy is not completely bleak, but it could be much better. The nation has had stagnant growth for much of the last two presidents terms, but as Rand Paul noted, even when George W. Bush attempted a modest tax cut, it gave the nation a boost for a period of time.

In standing with Donald Trumps ambitious tax cut plans, Rand Paul is staying true to himself and to this model. Trump has proven so far that he is a person of his word, and his proposed tax cuts would give this country the prosperity it so richly deserves.

If Trump doesnt follow through and it is just a read my lips moment, he will probably be a one-term president. He has Pauls support, so hopefully we can get America back on the right path to making it, once more, Great Again.",1
"49","75.txt","Undeniable Foul Play: U.S. Funded Facilities In Afghanistan Now Missing As Obama Leaves Office","U.S. Agency for International Developments (USAID) worked in Afghanistan from July 2008 through June 2015 under the Obama administration. The work there included supporting 30 Afghan health facilities. They spend nearly $260 million through the Partnership Contracts for Health Program.

The logic seems sounds, in a country at war; we can help by providing health care. Unfortunately, it seems that USAID is not accomplishing their tasks.

On the website, the USAID claims that during the current administration, The Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations. This must be code for, We will take millions to build hospitals and lose them, because this is exactly what the group has done.

Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John Sopko wrote to the agency, stating, One Afghanistan hospital funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development was located more than 430 miles away from the listed coordinates, while another 11 facilities were more than six miles away.

The letter elaborated, SIGAR sought to conduct site inspections at 30 of 79 facilities in Badakhshan  an Afghan province  but was unable to locate one facility. SIGAR found substantial inaccuracies in the geospatial coordinates USAID previously provided for many of these 29 health facilities and observed that not all facilities had access to electricity and drinking water.


The money to help is going somewhere else

Sopko went on to say that only 12 of the inspected facilities were located near the coordinates USAID provided. This means that only about 15% of the hospitals were in the places they were supposed to be.

In some cases, the coordinates given were not even in the correct country, coordinates for 22 of the 79 facilities were not located in the districts listed in the most recent information available to USAID. Coordinates for two health facilities were located in Pakistan; Afghanistans neighboring country to the southeast.

One health facility was actually listed as being in the Mediterranean Sea by USAID. Others were miles from the reported coordinates, four were more than six miles away from their listed coordinates, and another three were between three and six miles away. Another six facilities were between just over a half mile and three miles away, while nine were actually located within about a half mile of their listed location.

It seems as though this has been an ongoing problem for USAID. As SIGAR has stressed previously, robust program oversight requires specific knowledge of the location where the service is provided, Sopko wrote to USAID Administrator Gayle Smith.

A USAID official reported that it would not bother correcting the problem, The agency no longer maintains location data and obtaining it would require a specialized request to the Afghan government, which USAID was unwilling to make.

Sopko countered this statement, USAIDs position regarding its monitoring responsibilities is troubling. [W]e encourage USAID to request and maintain this information, in order to help ensure that funding spent to improve the health of specific populations is actually reaching the intended communities.

It would seem necessary for someone to step in and stop the funding to this program until it starts reporting correctly. Sopko emphasized the importance of this when he stated, Maintaining accurate GPS data would help the USAID conduct site visits and help ensure that the intended communities receive needed health services.

Instead of taking a closer look at what is really happening, the agency will go on funding health centers, providing another $228 million for the facilities. In turn, the United States will keep funding USAID. The bizarre circle of corruption will continue.

USAID has clearly stated their intentions going forward, USAID does not intend to maintain coordinates. They will instead rely on the World Bank and the Afghan government who are now handling the facilities.

Given this set of facts, the U.S. needs to withdraw its funding of the agency. Obama and liberals shown no signs that this will happen though.

The facilities that SIGAR Sopko was able to inspect were in poor condition. [W]e did observe some basic structural concerns at most of the facilities, such as cracked walls, leaking roofs, broken doors, and shattered windows, which indicate clear concerns with sanitation and safety.  Inspectors also found exposed wiring. Electrical deficiencies, such as exposed live wires, pose serious hazards that could endanger the safety of patients and staff.


Horrible conditions

This brings a chilling image of what kind of care the patients might be receiving. Liberals are not concerned that millions are disappearing into a bottomless pit.

Millions have gone to fund clinics that are either misplaced or in such disrepair that they should be closed. Millions more will be given before this funding runs out.

Why is nobody in Washington asking questions?

The answers will leave the White House with Obama. His dirty hands are all over this one as he stands in front of the American public and claims he is concerned, that the government is helping innocent citizens in the war torn country of Afghanistan.

As usual, this is all lies. A more likely scenario, given what we know now, is that he needed a reason to funnel money into the country and the facade of health clinics was believable at the time.

No more money should be sent to any program that Obama has started overseas. His close ties to terrorists should raise red flags for every American.

President Trump needs to undo all of these  projects so that we no longer operate maliciously, negligently, or in a corrupt manner.",1
"50","76.txt","Putin Goes On LIVE TV And CONFIRMS That Obama And Hillary Created ISIS","Trump said that Obama had a hand in creating ISIS. Now that Donald Trump is the president-elect, Vladimir Putin, of all people, has confirmed this.

Putin said the Syrian rebels are mercenaries who only fight for whomever pays them more. While the president of Russia did not come out and say it is America arming them, he definitely, strongly hinted at it.



Of course, this is the type of flawed leadership we have come to expect under the Obama administration. Putins strong words have also, sadly, been confirmed by other sources.

A Wikileaks report last August proved that Hillary actually lied under oath when she was asked about the weapons trade program that occurred with Syria starting a year before the Benghazi attacks. In the batch of leaked emails, an astonishing 17,000 of them were about Syria alone, as per The National Review.

Something tells me this isnt the type of experience that the Clinton team was going for when they were squaring off against Trump, but this is also solid verification of Putins statement.

In Clintons attempts to win what would essentially have been a third term for Obama, she would have contributed to the international discord and unrest we have all become painfully aware of.

Lets get something absolutely clear: in a world where America is not dominant on the world stage and where ISIS is allowed to grow stronger, those who love freedom lose. Those who believe in all our countrys wonderful principles would soon see them slip away.

The United States of America simply could not afford to have more of the same. We, and the rest of the world, could not afford to have the ISIS rebels grow stronger and more organized. In the midst of all this, Donald Trump began to throw out massive truth bombs, including that Obama and Clinton created ISIS by virtue of their policies. This seemed incredibly outrageous to liberals.

However, credit Trump for being bold enough to say it. This is definitely the type of leadership we need. There is no question it is a sad day in America when it is Vladimir Putin who sounds more like an American than even our own sitting president. Thankfully, well soon have a true leader in the White House.

Seriously, Obama, this isnt a game. This is being the leader of the free world. Go back to your looney-tunes professor job and community organizing and quit playing leader!",1

"53","79.txt","Just Days Before Leaving Office, Obama Gets News that Could INVALIDATE His Entire Presidency","President Barack Obamas legacy might soon be tarnished beyond repair. The long-awaited results from an in-depth investigation into Obamas past have just been revealed.

Barack Obamas birth certificate is a fake a complete forgery, and now evidence to prove it is headed to Congress. Arizona Sheriff Joe Apraios investigation into Obamas birth certificate found multiple inconsistencies, which could allow Congress to impeach the 44th president of the United States even after he leaves office, WND reports.

The forensic investigation into Obamas birth certificate reportedly proves the birthers were right all along! Jerome Corsi, Ph.D., a WND senior staff writer, is credited with forcing the Obama administration to release the document in the first place.

Corsis book, Wheres The Birth Certificate?, first brought the Obama birth certificate issue to the publics attention. The Constitution requires a presidential candidate to be a natural-born citizen but does not really define exactly what the entails  meaning even though Obama was born to an American woman, he still might not have qualified to run for the highest office in the land.

I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child, Obama once said, according to a report by the Miller Center. Obama spent four years of his childhood living in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather.

Sheriff Joe Apraios forensic investigation into Obamas birth certificate revealed the document presented to the public appears to be identical to and copied from another birth certificate issued in Hawaii just several days after he was born. The exceedingly similar birth certificate reportedly belongs to Johanna Ahnee.

The items on the supposed Obama birth certificate, which appear to have been copied from the Johanna Ahnee birth certificate, include the word Honolulu, the word Oahu twice, two time stamps, and three different Xs. The identical appearance of the Xs was reportedly of particular interest to forensic investigators.

The Xs would have been placed on the original birth certificate documents by moving a typewriter carriage and rolling over the certificate at the same time. Investigators reportedly found it interesting that the stamp made by Alvin Onaka and the April 25th stamp might have been lifted from another document.

One of the expert forensic investigators who participated in the review of the Obama birth certificate was Reed Hayes. He is a court-qualified document examiner and handwriting examiner.

Reed Hayes also operates a business in Hawaii. He has been on the board of Scientific Association of Forensic Examiners for almost four decades. Forlabs, an Italian company which specializes in extracting details and information from multimedia files, produced the results of the Obama birth certificate forensic investigation.

We had two experts from two countries in separate disciplines of forensics that came to one conclusion: Barack Obamas long form birth certificate it not authentic, the report said.

Mike Zullo, the lead forensic investigator involved with the report, quoted details from the investigation by Hayes: The (nail in the coffin) that proves that Certificate of Live Birth is inauthentic is the exact lineup of numerous entries on both [certificates]. Zullo added the experts likened the evidence they found to prove the Obama birth certificate is a forgery to being as reliable as a fingerprint.",1

According to Gersh Kuntzman, the murder of Karlov at the hands of a Turkish police officer shouting, Allahu akbar, and, Dont forget Aleppo, was not terrorism, but instead a noble act.
As Vladimir Putins man in Turkey, Karlov was the public face of that murderous dictators war crimes around the globe and of oppression at home, Kuntzman claims. Andrei Karlov is the human embodiment of policies that deployed bunker busters to kill babies, sent fighter planes on scorched earth bombing runs that destroyed a whole city, aided Syrian madman Bashar al-Assad in his campaign that has killed hundreds of thousands, and even ordered attacks on UN aid workers.

"57","82.txt","WikiLeaks  Obama Racist Recruiting  No White, Christian Americans Need Apply","Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House, many naive Americans still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian. Hes since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white-hating Muslim agitator, but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time. WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer.

There were those who knew what he was up to, but their silence had been purchased. One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share Obamas personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti-white, anti-American prejudice.

673-bansal-obama-discrimination

As the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. Thats the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ Civil Rights Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non-white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just who we are under this racist America-hating Islamist.

One thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration. Race-based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in. Being Arab alone wasnt enough to get you onto the good list. Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included.

She also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers. Two questions rise from that admission; what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she, knowing their background difficulties, still include them as potential recruits?

Subject: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates

 

Here are the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American

candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside

boards/agencies/policy committees. A couple things to note about the list

of Muslim American candidates:

 

1) In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab

American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many

Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of

outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim

American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of

uncertain religion (esp. Christian).

 

2) There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for a

Secretary-level job among the Muslim Americans. That said, on both lists,

there are some very senior people listed in the last category (for outside

boards/commissions) who conceivably could be considered for top jobs. The

very senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terribly

involved in politics or policy, or in the case of some Asian Americans,

had already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so I

thought we should seek new talent. But theres no magic to some of the

placements. I think the lists are fairly exhaustive, but some of the

people may be moved to other categories.

 

3) High-profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amount

of blogger criticism, and so the individuals on this list would need to be

ESPECIALLY carefully vetted. I suspect some of the people I list would

not survive such a vet  but I do personally know, at least in part,

virtually all of the candidates in the 1st two categories (but I know very

few of those listed for outside boards/commissions).

 

4) I listed the elected Muslim American democratic officials at the end

of the second category, but for various reasons, I didnt think any of

them would necessarily be suitable for an Administration appointment.

Nevertheless, I wanted to flag them for you in case you wanted to evaluate

them further.",1
"58","83.txt","Pro-Cruz Robocall Warns Nevada Voters of Impending Missile Strike","CARSON CITY, Nv.  A robocall dialed out to hundreds of thousands of conservative voters on Tuesday warned of an imminent missile strike on several cities in Nevada, including the state capital, Carson City. The call prompted a mass evacuation of potential Republican supporters from the state and has been blamed for at least twenty-five deaths.

Just hours before the start of Nevadas Republican caucus, potential voters received a forty-five second prerecorded phone call informing them that New York, Washington, and Los Angeles had just been obliterated by ballistic missiles. Evacuation orders have been issued for your state, the call calmly explained. You are to immediately report to your precincts designated polling center for further instructions.

The vast majority of those who received Tuesday afternoons robocall -perhaps out of fear of nuclear annihilation- didnt stay on the line long enough to find out that the call had been paid for by Ted Cruz for President and, according to the Texas senators campaign manager, was meant to merely warn voters of the dangers of a Trump presidency.

In an interview with MSNBCs Chuck Todd, Senator Cruz said that such calls are common during primary season and accused his fellow candidates of forming a behind-the-scenes alliance in order to conduct a dishonest and misleading smear campaign against him. The senator expressed sadness over the tragic loss of at least two-dozen potential voters who perished trying to flee a fictitious Nevadan Hiroshima but blamed his rivals for taking parts of the call out of context in order to discredit him at the expense of the good people of Nevada.

Meanwhile, statements released by the Trump and Rubio camps called for a complete redo of the Nevada caucus. While Senator Rubio accused Cruz of denying people their constitutional rights; Donald Trump complained that Cruzs deceptive tactics had likely cost him millions of votes.

The Nevada caucus marks the final GOP primary leading up to Super Tuesday on March 1st.",1
"59","84.txt","Special Report: Obamas Bathroom Breaks Cost Taxpayers $4.1 Billion in 2015","WASHINGTON, D.C.  According to a new report scheduled for public release this week by the Government Accountability Office, President Obamas bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015. Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took 3.5 bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less.

By the GAOs estimate, the commander-in-chief spent just over eighty-five hours in the bathroom in 2015 alone. The question on everyones mind when they look at a report like this is, What exactly is he doing in there?' Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted to C-SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day on a good day.

Even so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October 23rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record-breaking twenty-one minute bathroom break. I think its very telling, Senator McCain said.

The average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days, said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. Ideally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight, Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, With that said, President Obama -who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement.

However, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. In all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict, Dr. Gupta told Real News Right Now.

Despite President Obamas low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above-average amount of toilet paper and -if hes a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the mens room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping $4.1 billion.

This is simply unacceptable, Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. This is the kind of imprudent overzealous spending that I intend to do away with. Senator Rubio said he and other Republican congressmen -in an effort to save taxpayers a buck or two, often wear adult diapers while on Capitol Hill. Its uncomfortable but from a moral standpoint, its the right thing to do. We as elected officials owe that much to our constituents.",1
"60","85.txt","ISIS Leadership Among Top GOP Campaign Contributors","WASHINGTON, D.C.  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and other members of the Islamic States leadership council have provided more than five million dollars in campaign contributions to Republican presidential candidates this year, according to a campaign finance report released by the Republican National Committee last week.

According to the report, more than half of the GOPs leading presidential contenders including Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have received upwards of one million dollars from the Islamic State. However, specific standards set in place by the Federal Election Committee limit individual donors to a maximum contribution of $2,700 per year. In addition, the FEC strictly prohibits foreign nationals from making any sort of contribution toward elections held in the United States.

To the delight of the RNC, the Islamic State has found a convenient loophole to bypass these restrictions. Using the same global financial networks already in place meant to provide funding to its various terror operations, ISIS is able to funnel cash through a number of waypoints before it reaches sympathetic Americans residing in the United States. Then, using funds provided by the Islamic State, individuals simply write a check for the maximum donation allowed, payable to a presidential candidates campaign.

Its really an ingenious system, said James Arevalo, assistant campaign manager for Senator Ted Cruz. Obviously the senator doesnt see eye to eye with the Islamic State on some issues, Arevalo told CNN, continuing, That said, we certainly share very similar beliefs and values with ISIS, particularly when it comes to womens rights and gun control. Arevalo added that candidates have a moral obligation to meet the uphold the values of supporters and donors alike.

In the wake of the nations most recent mass shooting that left fourteen people dead and another twenty-two injured in San Bernardino, California, the Republican party, at the request of the Islamic State and the National Rifle Association, once again blocked legislation that would enact stricter gun control policies in the United States.

Currently there are an estimated 700,000 people on the U.S. governments terror watch list with several thousand residing in the United States. Legislation proposed by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein would have prevented terror suspects, felons, and individuals with a history of mental illness from purchasing firearms.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, who opposed the legislation, told CBS This Morning that the act of blocking suspected terrorists and convicted felons from legally obtaining firearms would infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens.",1

They need a little touch of reality, the president said, receiving a wide applause from the audience. This isnt an audition for the babysitters club, its the Oval Office. In the past, President Obama has publicly questioned whether or not the current Republican presidential hopefuls possess the intellectual and moral fortitude required to run the country.

Cunningham continued, Itll be interesting to see how they field questions from a seasoned politician, particularly one that knows the ins and outs of the job theyre vying for.

Meanwhile, former Vice Presidential nominee and reality TV star Sarah Palin railed against the Obama administration for once again trying to sandbag the Republican party and suggested the president might be better suited leading a morning call to prayer.

Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, who many speculate will play good cop to President Obamas bad cop during the debate, visited the White House this week to brainstorm possible debate questions with the president. Im told the meeting was very constructive, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday afternoon.

Prominent Black Lives Matter activist and rapper Tef Poe has a message for white people: If Donald Trump wins the presidency, niggas will incite riots everywhere.

Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know, Poe tweeted today.

He followed up with another promise: Trump wins aint no more rules fammo. Weve been too nice as is.

Poe is by no means a nobody, he has appeared in innumerable articles charting the rise of Black Lives Matter and was credited with coining the phrase, This aint your grandparents civil rights movement.

The rapper was one of the co-founders of Hands Up United, a social justice organization that emerged after the death of Michael Brown that was responsible for coordinating large BLM protests in the St. Louis area.

St. Louis was hit by riots in August last year as police were forced to use tear gas to disperse demonstrators who threw bricks and bottles at officers.

The hands up, dont shoot! mantra was later discredited by DNA and autopsy evidence that confirmed Michael Brown did not have his hands up when he was shot by Officer Darren Wilson.

Poes threat to incite riots comes on the same day as it emerged that some of the radical groups involved in shutting down Donald Trumps rally in Chicago last week are planning a mass civil disobedience movement beginning next month.

Donald Trump himself also warned that any attempt by the GOP establishment to steal the nomination from him may result in civil unrest.

I think you would have riots. I think you would have riots, Trump told CNNs Chris Cuomo this morning. I think you would see problems like youve never seen before. I think bad things would happen. I really do.

Trump was quickly blasted by many sectors of the media for invoking the prospect of riots, a sentiment that wasnt seen immediately after the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, when publications like Time Magazine argued that rioting was a justifiable form of protest.",1

The House Just Voted 383-0 In Support of Christians Obama Isnt Happy About This","The Obama administration refuses to even utter the words radical Islamic terrorism, so its no surprise that they have refused to call the murders of Christians by ISIS genocide, but thats exactly what it is. ISIS is literally trying to totally eliminate entire populations of people who do not believe the way they do.

When the House votes 383-0 against Obama, you know there is something majorly wrong with the mentality of the White House.

From Fox News:

The House approved a resolution Monday that declares the Islamic State is committing genocide against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East  putting even more pressure on the Obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this week.

The resolution passed the House with a unanimous vote of 383-0.

The resolution came to a vote just days after the release of a graphic new report by the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians on ISIS atrocities. The report made the case that the terror campaign against Christians and other minorities in Syria, Iraq and other parts of the Middle East is, in fact, genocide.

When ISIS systematically targets Christians, Yezidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination, this is not only a grave injusticeit is a threat to civilization itself, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., said in a statement. We must call the violence by its proper name: genocide.

The resolution was voted on ahead of a congressionally mandated March 17 deadline for Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration. The measure is an effort to force the administrations hand on the issue, as the administration has so far declined to take an official position.

There is a similar measure in the Senate that has yet to be voted on.

Obama may want to protect Islam and disregard Christians, but it is abundantly clear there are hundreds of leaders in the House and Senate who do not agree with Obamas notions.

If the resolution passes the Senate at a similar margin as the house, it will solidify the level of embarrassment our country feels toward Obama.",1

You see, Hillary Clinton managed to win the classic blue states (both of which have massive sanctuary cities) by 4.2 million in California and 1.8 million in New York.

In fact, by those numbers, it is safe to say that California alone is the ENTIRE reason Clinton won the popular vote and California does NOT speak for the entire country.

This is exactly why the electoral college exists, though. These 2 states do not account for the entire nation. They know NOTHING about the problems in places like Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Florida, all of which voted Trump. (H/T  Daily Mail)

This is what she needed to win the party nomination for the 2016 Presidential race. She is officially the first woman nominee of a major U.S. political party. The Associated Press released a new count of her pledged delegates and showed that she has reached the magic number.

*** This is an outright lie.

Besides being suspiciously announced right before the California primary tomorrow. A spokesman for Bernie Sanders, Michael Briggs said Monday that the number that was released today depends on superdelegates. This means that this is not an official victory.

It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgement, are ignoring the Democratic National Committees clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer, he said.

*** What else would you expect from CROOKED Hillary?



Briggs says that Sanders could potentially change the minds of those superdelegates before the Democratic Convention.

Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination, he said. She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then. They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race.

Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump.

The Clinton campaign tweeted the following:

In another recent tweet, Clinton said that we are on the brink of a historic moment, but we still have work to do.

"72","96.txt","Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide","WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.



During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values.

The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is, Obama said. Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovahs Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this one nation under God, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying liberty and justice for all, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.

Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of under God runs afoul of the First Amendments establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects Americas values.

I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyones beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obamas decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in Novembers general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledges language and suggested that the pledges mention of God sends the wrong message to Americas children.

I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the presidents order, referring to the president as an illegitimate Muslim traitor.



As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban.

This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools. Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.

Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obamas decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.

When our children are forced to chant, One nation under God, whose God are they referring to exactly? Ketchum said, From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a childs involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values. Ketchum continued, This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.

While Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.

Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a presidents executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.



Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.

It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then well burn in Hell for eternity.

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. Mikkleson continues, A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like umimumimaginative, recycled, hoax, saying that a story illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, thats a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences. Mikkelson further explains, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, its so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. But we dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?

Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in 1887, The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress in 1942. The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words under God were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place.

"73","97.txt","Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The National Anthem At All Sporting Events Nationwide","WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 14302, which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide. Under the new order, it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue. Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events, this is where the new order will have its biggest impact. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to 5,000 dollars and up to one year in federal prison.



The president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality. The President went on to say that the language used in the anthem is violent and hostile to African Americans.

If the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything, its that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse. Our nation is being torn apart by a song, a song that is outdated and, jingoistic. Without swift action, we cannot move forward as a nation; we cannot heal the wounds of racial division. How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing?

Obama said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation.

The days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end, Obama said. We need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming, not the nation we used to be.

It has now been over two months since Kaepernick was first spotted sitting down as the national anthem was sung at a preseason NFL game because he refused to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.

In a relatively short period of time, his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and sparked a debate not only about the state of race relations in America, but about what exactly it means to be a patriot.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of President Obamas decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in Novembers general election. She echoed his concerns about the anthems militaristic language and called it one of the last remnants of slavery.



Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had some harsh words for both President Obama and democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the new Executive Order.

The hatred that President Obama and crooked Hillary have for this country really knows no bounds, Trump said at a press conference this morning in southern Iowa. I can tell you that when Im elected Ill have them both thrown in jail, and Ill make sure that they have to listen to the anthem in their jail cells all day long. I just hope we can stop them from rigging the election.

Chicago Cubs third baseman Paul Horner said that he will refuse to play until the Presidents order is reversed.

The national anthem is part of the game, Horner told ESPN. He might as well outlaw peanuts and crackerjacks. We always sing the anthem before we play ball, so if they arent going to sing the anthem, Im not going to play ball. I think youre going to find that Im not the only one who feels this way. Ive already got at least ten teammates who are ready to join me in a show of solidarity. I really think we can start a trend here.

The reaction to the new Executive Order has not been all negative, however. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who has himself taken a knee in protest of the National Anthem, called this A great day not just for African Americans, but for all Americans who value freedom. He said that encouraging people to sing a song that contains such blatant nationalism and militarism makes us no better than North Korea, and causes the majority of Americans to behave like a pack of rabid, mind-controlled zombies.

Obama also managed to garner the support of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred.

People like to watch sports because they provide a distraction from their day to day lives. the commissioners office told CNN via e-mail. There no need to taint that with political statements. I applaud the Presidents leadership on this difficult issue.



Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.

This is a story about President Obama banning the National Anthem at sporting events around the country, Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he disagrees with the President

What the President really needs to do is put a ban on masturbation in this country. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then well burn in Hell for eternity.

While Executive Order 14302 is likely to be challenged in court, experts say it could be tied up for years, meaning that it is unlikely to be reversed before it takes effect on December 1st. In the meantime, they say to expect numerous protests from those who disagree with the presidents decision.

Hello South Carolina! Are you ready to get weird or what? Murray said to the roaring crowd.

Murrays speech, which lasted a little more than an hour, touched on many issues from his campaign, including increased wages, health care, the cost of higher education and human rights in general. The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke.

I saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach, Murray told the crowd. Here are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and theyre acting like 4-year-olds. Theyre up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself; I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this.

Political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago.



I dont know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if hes just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. Hes getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what hes doing.

I pretty much dont like any of the candidates that are running for President right now, Murray told the crowd, I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em, are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion. Murray continued, Im always traveling around the world, but Im proud to call America, the good ole U.S. of A, my home. I think theres a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but theres also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People dont know what to make of these Hitler wanna-bes like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruzs, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And its sad that people go along with it, and cant see it for what it really is.

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.

We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and cant be bought, Bradley said. I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; hes such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.

Murray finished the rally by saying, Im no hero, I just want to help out, and I hope you all choose to stand behind me, or beside me, or wherever is comfortable for you, but just as long as its with me. Look, we dont need to make America great again, because it already is; we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then thats sort of how youre supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible!

Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent.

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money, Mikkelson said. The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, its actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie-cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our writers will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the articles headline that were debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and thats it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! Ill tell what, if it wasnt for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldnt have been able to go to college. Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a fake news site, so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon.

Murrays campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March 2nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night. It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting with locals and telling a few jokes. Tickets to that show are only $10.",1
"75","99.txt","REPORT: Nine ISIS Supporters Arrested Near Washington D.C.","At least nine individuals have been arrested in Northern Virginia for attempting to support ISIS since the group rose to power in 2014, according to a report from law enforcement officials.

According to the report, which was obtained by The Washington Times, the nine individuals were arrested for providing or attempting to provide support to ISIS and included a police officer and several U.S. Army soldiers.

The Washington Times reports:

Law enforcement agencies have arrested nine Northern Virginia residents on charges of aiding the Islamic State since the terrorist group rose to power in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and launched social media propaganda to attract followers, a government message to police states.



Of the nine Northern Virginians who were arrested, all but one were in their teens and early 20s. They included a police officer, a Starbucks barista, Army soldiers, bankers and a cabdriver. Four of the nine graduated from Northern Virginia high schools, one with honors. Two attended Northern Virginia Community College.

According to the Times, one of the men, a U.S. army combat engineer named Mohammad Bilor Jalloh, attempted to purchase firearms in an attempt to carry out a Fort Hood style attack.

Another man, Metro police officer Nicholas Young, traveled to Libya and gave advice to Islamic State followers on how to avoid law enforcement monitoring according to law enforcement officials.

Several others planned on creating online propaganda for the terror group, with one seeking to encourage lone wolf style attacks on Washington DC.

The report raises new concerns about the reach of the terror group into the U.S. homeland, and any future plans to import new refugees from troubled Muslim nations.

"76","1000.txt","Leak reveals Rex Tillerson was director of Bahamas-based US-Russian oil firm","Rex Tillerson, the businessman nominated by Donald Trump to be the next US secretary of state, was the long-time director of a US-Russian oil firm based in the tax haven of the Bahamas, leaked documents show.

Tillerson  the chief executive of ExxonMobil  became a director of the oil companys Russian subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas, in 1998. His name  RW Tillerson  appears next to other officers who are based at Houston, Texas; Moscow; and Sakhalin, in Russias far east.


 Who is Donald Trumps secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson?
The leaked 2001 document comes from the corporate registry in the Bahamas. It was one of 1.3m files given to the Germany newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung by an anonymous source. The registry is public but details of individual directors are typically incomplete or missing entirely. 

Though there is nothing untoward about this directorship, it has not been reported before and is likely to raise fresh questions over Tillersons relationship with Russia ahead of a potentially stormy confirmation hearing by the US senate foreign relations committee. Exxon said on Sunday that Tillerson was no longer a director after becoming the companys CEO in 2006.

ExxonMobils use of offshore regimes  while legal  may also jar with Trumps avowal to put America first.

Tillersons critics say he is too close to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and that his appointment could raise potential conflicts of interest.

ExxonMobil is the worlds largest oil company and has for a long time been eyeing Russias vast oil and gas deposits. Tillerson currently has Exxon stock worth more than $200m.


Since his nomination, Tillersons Russia ties have become a source of bipartisan concern. In 2013, Putin awarded him the Russian Order of Friendship. Tillerson is close to Igor Sechin, the head of Russian state oil company Rosneft and the de facto second most powerful figure inside the Kremlin. A hardliner, Sechin is ex-KGB.

Tillersons award followed a 2011 deal between ExxonMobil and Rosneft to explore the Kara Sea, in Russias Arctic.

It was put on hold in 2014 after the Obama administration imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russia. The sanctions were punishment for Putins Crimea annexation that spring and Russias undercover invasion of eastern Ukraine.

The ban covers the US sharing of sophisticated offshore and shale oil technology. Exxon was supposed to halt its drilling with Rosneft. The firm successfully pleaded with the US Treasury department to delay the ban by a few weeks, with the Kremlin threatening to seize its rig. In this brief window Exxon discovered a major Arctic field with some 750m barrels of new oil.

Tillerson has criticised the US governments policy on Russia. In 2014 he told Exxons annual meeting that we do not support sanctions. He added: We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who they are really harming.

It is widely assumed by investors that the new Trump administration will drop sanctions. This would allow the Kara joint venture to resume, boosting Exxons share price and yielding potential profits in the tens of billions of dollars. According to company records, Tillerson currently owns $218m of stock. His Exxon pension is worth about $70m.

The Senate foreign relations committee is currently split 10 to 9 between Republicans and Democrats. But several heavyweight Republicans, including John McCain, have raised doubts about Tillersons nomination and his lack of experience to be Americas top diplomat after four decades spent exclusively in the oil industry.

Republican senator Marco Rubio  who sits on the committee  said on Tuesday that he had serious concerns about giving Tillerson the job. Rubio praised him as a respected businessman but said that the next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity [and who] has a clear sense of Americas interests.

Tillerson is likely to get rid of his Exxon stock if the narrowly Republican-majority Senate confirms his appointment.

Controversy over his links with Russia comes at a time when the topic is politically red hot, after the CIA said earlier this month that Kremlin hackers had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats in order to help Trump. The president-elect has dismissed the CIAs assessment, calling it ridiculous. The Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, says Putin targeted her for reasons of personal revenge.

As well as on oil and gas, the Obama administration has imposed personal sanctions on Putins friends, including Sechin. Sechin has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson. Currently, Sechin is forbidden from entering the country.

This new revelation about Tillersons directorship sheds light on the use by multinational companies of contrived offshore structures, now under scrutiny following Aprils massive Panama Papers leak.

Exxon Neftegass most important oil and gas project is Sakhalin-1. It is located in the sub-Arctic, off the frozen and difficult-to-access north-east coast of Russias Sakhalin island. This is 10,700km (6,650 miles) away from the subsidiarys official business home in Nassau, the semi-tropical capital of the Bahamas. The Bahamas is notorious for secrecy and has a corporate tax rate of zero.

The documents from the Bahamas corporate registry were shared by Süddeutsche Zeitung with the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC. They show that Exxon registered at least 67 companies in the secretive tax haven, covering operations in countries from Russia to Venezuela to Azerbaijan.

Exxon Neftegas features in about 25 leaked offshore documents. The oil firm was incorporated in 1998 by a law firm in Nassau, Higgs & Johnson. Another veteran law firm, Lobosky Management Ltd, subsequently took over as registered agent. The company secretary, Sophia Kishinevsky, signed the paperwork and made annual filings.

Exxon said it had no comment on whether Tillerson should now divest his Exxon holdings and resign from his positions with all Exxon entities. It said the oil firm had incorporated some of its affiliates in the Bahamas because of simplicity and predictability.

It is not done to reduce tax in the country where the company operates, Exxon said. Incorporation of a company in the Bahamas does not decrease ExxonMobils tax liability in the country where the entity generates its income.

The firm was one of the largest taxpayers in the world, with an effective global tax rate in 2015 of 34%, it said. Its effective tax rate over the past three years  2013, 2014, 2015  was 43%, it added. This compared favourably with other Fortune 100 companies, which have substantially lower effective tax rates than ExxonMobil.",2
"77","1001.txt","Trump picks budget 'hawk' Mick Mulvaney to lead budget office","President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Mick Mulvaney, a conservative Republican congressman from South Carolina who is known as a budget hawk, as director of the Office of Management and Budget.

In a statement issued on Saturday morning  shortly after Trump tweeted an inflammatory comment about Chinas seizure of a US navy drone in the South China Sea  Trump called Mulvaney a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nations finances and save our country from drowning in red ink.

Trump also said that with Mulvaney as his budget director, his administration would make smart choices and renew the American taxpayers trust in how their money is spent.

Mulvaney said he would help restore budgetary and fiscal sanity  after eight years of an out-of-control, tax-and-spend financial agenda under Barack Obama.

Like other Trump nominations, the budget directors job requires Senate approval.

Mulvaneys nomination follows a pattern of Trump turning to individuals with records apparently hostile to the agencies they are nominated to lead.

For example, the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, a leading critic of climate change theories, has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

In other such moves, the billionaire and charter schools advocate Betsy DeVos has been nominated as education secretary and the Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, a critic of voting rights legislation, has been nominated as attorney general.

The announcement about Mulvaney was made as Trump, who takes office on 20 January, began his holiday vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his oceanfront club in Palm Beach, Florida.

Mulvaney, 49, was an outspoken critic of the former House speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. 

His selection points to a strategy by Trump to cut government where he can. The president-elect has recently railed against what he has called a far too expensive new version of the Air Force One aircraft he will use, which Boeing is supposed to build.

With Mick at the head of OMB, Trump said in his statement, my administration is going to make smart choices about Americas budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayers trust in how their money is spent.

Mulvaney said: Each day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard-earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hard-working Americans do every day, he said.

On Friday night, Trump vowed to seek approval from Congress for $1tn in new spending to rebuild the countrys crumbling network of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure as a way to create jobs and make some needed repairs.

We are going to fix our country. Its time. We have no choice. Its time, Trump said at a rally in Orlando, Florida.",2
"78","1002.txt","Trump has no idea how to run a superpower, say Chinese media","Donald Trump appears to have not a clue how to lead a superpower.

That was the conclusion of Chinas Global Times newspaper on Monday morning as the countrys media weighed in on the president-elects latest social media assaults on Beijing.


Don't let China ties slide into 'full conflict mode', Obama urges Trump
 Read more
Trump is not behaving as a president who will become master of the White House in a month, the Communist party controlled newspaper wrote in an editorial. He bears no sense of how to lead a superpower.

The article came after the US president-elect again used Twitter, which has been blocked in China since 2009, to berate the leaders of the worlds second largest economy.

China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters  rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented [sic] act, Trump tweeted early on Saturday morning after it emerged the Chinese navy had seized a US naval drone that had been operating in the South China Sea.

In a second tweet, Trump wrote:

Those 221 characters threatened to further alienate Chinas rulers, already reeling from Trumps recent decision to hold a 10-minute phone call with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, and threat to upend long-standing US policy on Taiwan.

On Friday, President Obama cautioned Trump against allowing relations with China slip into full conflict mode.

In its editorial, the fervently nationalist Global Times, a state-run tabloid that sometimes reflects official thinking, indicated such a deterioration was certainly on the cards if Trump continued to act up.

People in China were unsure whether the billionaires attacks on Beijing were part of attempts to wage a psychological war or simply an example of his amateurishness.

But if he treats China after assuming office in the same way as in his tweets, China will not exercise restraint, the newspaper warned. The Chinese government should be fully prepared for a hardline Trump.

In an online video that has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, the newspapers controversial editor, Hu Xijin, said: I dont know if he is playing the psychological card with China or is in fact just unprofessional  China should teach him some lessons so he might learn to respect China after he is sworn in.

A comment piece on the front page of the overseas edition of the Communist partys official mouthpiece, the Peoples Daily, also suggested Beijing would not be cowed by Trumps provocations.

It is difficult to understand his true psychology, wrote Hua Yiwen, whom the paper described as an international affairs expert. But China shouldnt spend much effort trying to guess what he is thinking. We should simply stand firm, take control of the situation and handle it calmly.

Bill Bishop, a Washington DC-based China expert, said he sensed abject despair in the US capital at how Trump was conducting US-China relations through misspelled tweets.

This is unpresidented behaviour by a precedent-elect, joked Bishop. It would be funny if the stakes werent so high.

This is not a business deal. This is a political relationship between nuclear powers who are already on the path towards conflict in several dimensions, added Bishop, who publishes the influential Sinocism newsletter.

This kind of uncertainty, this kind of petulance, this kind of random tweeting  is not a grand strategy that is going to push the Chinese on to their heels so they are going to make concessions. This is juvenile, immature, inexperienced behaviour that has the potential to lead to many problems in the US-China relationship, some of which could have some pretty serious and damaging ramifications.

Bishop questioned the Chinese medias suggestion that Trumps tweets were part of a wily psychological ploy to force trade concessions from Beijing. I wouldnt ascribe brilliant psychological warfare skills to Donald Trump, he said.

Was it possible Trumps tweets were part of an ingenious new master plan for Sino-US relations that would emerge after his inauguration on 20 January? Bishop was skeptical.

I think that is about as likely as Xi Jinping waking up on 1 December, 2017 and declaring China a democracy.",2

""I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently,"" he said.
The Republican insisted his strategy was more ""sophisticated"".
He won nearly three million fewer votes than the Democratic candidate, but prevailed in the electoral college.
The arcane but all-important institution formally certified him earlier this week as winner of the 2016 presidential election.
But the Manhattan billionaire is apparently still chafing at critics' claims that he lacks a popular mandate.

Late last month he erroneously claimed in a tweet that ""in addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally"".

"80","1004.txt","Trump presidency: What his new team teaches us","As Donald Trump's 20 January inauguration draws closer, the president-elect's administration is starting to take shape. What does it tell us about what we can expect from the Trump presidency?
Although the incoming president has to fill more than 4,000 executive branch jobs scattered across dozens of agencies, departments and bureaus, there are 21 top-level Cabinet positions that require Senate confirmation. So far the Trump transition team has announced nominees for 15 of the spots (a 16th, interior secretary, is reportedly going to Ryan Zinke of Montana).
First, the basics. Of those 16, 11 are white men. For the first time since 1993, none of the top four departments - state, defence, treasury or justice - will be headed by a woman or a member of an ethnic minority group.
Ben Carson, tapped for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is the only African American. Elaine Chao (transportation) and Nikki Haley (UN ambassador) are the only Asians.
Six have previously held elective office, and one - Ms Chao - has prior experience running a federal agency. That marks a significant change from past presidential administrations, which were well stocked with more experienced political hands.
Mr Trump's Cabinet is a mix of rich businessmen, former military leaders and conservative true-believers. He may have campaigned as an anti-establishment outsider, but he's mostly surrounding himself with powerful, wealthy, influential men. While many may be outsiders to the game of elective politics, they're not exactly drawn from the ranks of the angry populist masses.
Here's a closer look at how it all shakes out.

Rex Tillerson hopes to move from the ExxonMobil boardroom to White House Cabinet meetings
American voters elected a businessman with no political experience as their president, and he's filled many of his top administration jobs with businessmen who have no political experience.
Leading the way are Rex Tillerson, who has helmed the international energy conglomerate ExxonMobil since 2006, as secretary of state, and venture capitalist and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury.
Other notable picks include the so-called ""king of bankruptcy"", Wilbur Ross, for commerce and fast food mogul Andrew Puzder at Labor.
What we've learned: Mr Trump campaigned against a global elite that he said was stripping the working class of its wealth. By looking to Wall Street insiders and corporate chieftains for key administration spots, however, his post-election actions signal a decidedly different mentality.

Here come the generals
At one point during the campaign, Mr Trump quipped that he knew more about fighting the so-called Islamic State than many of the generals currently running US military operations. When it came time to fill out his national security apparatus, however, the president-elect has frequently turned to the military brass.

James Mattis (defence) and John Kelly (homeland security) are both retired generals, as is Michael Flynn, who Mr Trump has slated for national security adviser (a position that does not require Senate confirmation).
Taken individually, the picks are unremarkable - ex-military leaders sometimes wind up in the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans. Colin Powell was George W Bush's secretary of state, and David Petraeus ran the Central Intelligence Agency under Barack Obama.
Together, however, Mr Trump's picks give his administration a decidedly martial bent. While he may have mocked Mr Obama's generals, Mr Trump, who attended military school as a youth, seems inclined to favour the spit and polish of military leadership.
The military is one of the few institutions still viewed favourably by the American public, and Mr Trump seems more than happy to march along with it.
What we've learned: Candidate Trump often espoused a less interventionist foreign policy on the campaign trail, but President-elect Trump's decision to surround himself with generals could indicate he will be quicker on the trigger.

The vanquished
Former presidential candidate Rick Perry once called Mr Trump a cancer on the Republican Party. Ben Carson, another primary opponent, questioned the business mogul's religious faith. Now Mr Trump has chosen both to head Cabinet departments in his administration.

There's a certain amount of irony in Mr Perry's selection, given that he is slotted to head the Department of Energy, which he famously forgot the name of when listing Cabinet-level posts he'd cut during a 2008 Republican primary debate.
Although Mr Trump has only named two former adversaries to his administration, he's also rumoured to be considering former computer executive Carly Fiorina for an intelligence agency post. Then there's New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was reportedly offered several Cabinet-level positions after being passed over for attorney general.
He's a foe-turned-friend who now, it seems, has been forgotten.
What we've learned: Facing off against Mr Trump in the past isn't necessarily a deal-breaker for the president-elect, but a subsequent bent knee - offered both by Mr Carson and Mr Perry - is a key to bygones being bygones.

The insiders
According to a recent story in Politico, Mr Trump's transition team has been beset by conflicts between establishment party players, led by incoming chief-of-staff Reince Priebus, and the conservative outsiders who helped run the Trump campaign.
In a number of Cabinet positions, it appears the establishment landed the people they wanted. Tom Price, slated for Health and Human Services, is a member of the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. Betsy DeVos, heading to education, is a long-time conservative activist and Republican Party donor. Elaine Chao served as labour secretary under President George W Bush and is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, considered a party rising star, is the nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations.
Given that Mr Trump is likely to be a hands-off president when it comes to the day-to-day management of his administration, department heads will wield considerable power over the next four years.
While the president-elect has said there are portions of Barack Obama's healthcare reform that he likes, for instance, chances are Mr Price will use his health secretary authority to strip the programme of much of its power. While he may sit down with former Vice-President Al Gore to talk climate change, his Environmental Protection Agency nominee, Scott Pruitt, is an outspoken critic - and legal opponent - of the agency he will head.
What we've learned: Mr Trump railed against the political establishment on the campaign trail, but some of his nominees are very comfortable in the Washington ""swamp"". The tension between the insiders and the outsiders in the Trump transition team is likely to continue well into his presidency.

(She is also the largest donor to the Trump family's charitable foundation.)
Another Trump donor, Todd Ricketts, has landed a deputy position in the Commerce Department.
Meanwhile, some early, outspoken Trump advocates were passed over for plum positions - including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. They emerged from the political graveyard to take an early gamble on Mr Trump, but they have yet to be rewarded for their efforts.

"81","1005.txt","Report: White House preparing response to Russian election interference","The Obama administration is preparing to announce a response, which may include cyber-operations, to the alleged Russian interference in last months election, according to a Washington Post report citing anonymous U.S. officials.

The report says that details are still being finalized but are likely to include new economic sanctions.

President Obama has said that his administration would respond to Russian meddling in the U.S. election. 

I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing, Mr. Obama told NPRs Steve Inskeep earlier this month. Some of it may be ... explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be.

Intelligence officials believed Russia was involved in the hacking of Democratic servers last summer. Russia dismisses the charges.

Ian Bremmer on impact of Russia hack, China drone controversy
A 2015 executive order, as intended, gives the president the authority to respond to foreign cyberattacks. However, officials concluded that the order did not give the president authority to respond to Russian meddling in American elections, prompting a last-ditch effort within the administration to expand the presidents authority on the matter.

According to the Post, officials are also trying to figure out ways to make it difficult for president-elect Trump, who has frequently spoken of improving relations with Russia, from diminishing any response from the Obama administration.

Part of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back, the Post quotes a senior administration official as saying.

The announcement of the response could come as early as this week, the paper states. Officials quoted in the story say they hope to create a deterrent against future election meddling by other nations.

"82","1006.txt","Donald Trump accuses President Obama of ""roadblocks"" during transition","President-elect Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against President Obama on Wednesday, accusing the current president of roadblocks leading up to Inauguration Day.

In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said he was doing [his] best to disregard the inflammatory  statements and roadblocks from Mr. Obama:

Mr. Trump was presumably still responding to Mr. Obamas comments in a podcast interview released Monday, in which he said he would have been able to mobilize Americans against Mr. Trump had he been able to run for a third term in 2016.

I am confident in this vision because Im confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I couldve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it, Mr. Obama said in the interview with David Axelrod, his former senior political advisor, which was released on Axelrods podcast AxeFiles. I know that in conversations that Ive had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one.

These comments appear to have gotten under Mr. Trumps skin: Wednesdays tweet is the third in three days about Mr. Obama.

On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that there is NO WAY Mr. Obama could have defeated him if he had been able to run for a third term this year:

And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Mr. Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost:

Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama seemed to move past the scathing campaign trail rhetoric in the weeks immediately following Election Day, talking by phone on several occasions and speaking in positive terms about their interactions.

In a meeting with The New York Times in November, Mr. Trump described his great meeting with Mr. Obama. I didnt know if Id like him, Mr. Trump said. I probably thought that maybe I wouldnt, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot.

But as Inauguration Day approaches, it appears that goodwill is not going to last. Mr. Trump has been critical of several of Mr. Obamas recent decisions, including the abstention on the United Nations Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements.

Mr. Obama, too, has offered veiled criticisms of Mr. Trump in recent public speeches and appearances. For example, speaking aside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that even when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.",2

Tom brings enormous depth and breadth of knowledge and experience to protecting the homeland to our senior White House team, Mr. Trump said in a statement. He has a handle on the complexity of homeland security, counterterrorism, and cybersecurity challenges. He will be an invaluable asset to our Administration.

The post will be a return to the White House for Bossert, who previously served as the deputy homeland security advisor to former President George W. Bush. Before that, he spent two years as the White Houses director of infrastructure protection policy.

Since leaving the White House, Bossert has run a national security consulting business and served as a fellow at the Atlantic Council focusing on cybersecurity.

Mr. Trumps transition team said the position for which Bossert was selected has recently been performed by a deputy to the National Security Advisor, but that in Mr. Trumps administration the job is being elevated and restored to its independent status. 

Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.) will serve as Mr. Trumps National Security Advisor.

"84","1008.txt","Carl Paladino, Trump campaign N.Y. co-chair, says his derogatory Obama remarks were a ""mistake""","ALBANY, N.Y. - A businessman who co-chaired the Trump campaign in New York state said Tuesday his recent derogatory statements about President Barack Obama and his wife werent meant for publication but were nevertheless inappropriate and a mistake.

Carl Paladino said he intended his email response to a weekly alternative publications survey to only go to a couple friends, not the newspaper. He said he mistakenly hit reply on his computer instead of forward.

The millionaire developer told Artvoice last week he hoped President Obama would die from mad cow disease and Michelle Obama would return to being a male.

In Paladinos Tuesday statement, first reported on Buffalos WBEN radio, he apologizes to minorities, saying he never intended to hurt them with his anti-Obama remarks. The comments sparked outrage from various political circles, including Trumps transition team, which called the developers comments absolutely reprehensible.

Paladinos comments even drew a rebuke from his own son William, who runs the familys development firm. The younger Paladino called the statements disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary.

The fathers earlier comments about the president prompted at least two petitions, one calling for his removal from the Buffalo school board and the other seeking the removal of his name from a student town house at St. Bonaventure University, his alma mater and recipient of more than $1 million in donations from Carl Paladino over the years.

Paladino, a school board member since 2013, also said he wont resign his elected position on the board.

No, Im not leaving the school board, he said in the statement, not when its time to help implement the real choice elements of Trumps plan for education reform.

The board is holding a special meeting Thursday to discuss board member conduct. In New York, school board members typically can only be removed by the state education commissioner.

Paladino, 70, unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010 as a Republican. The Democrat who defeated him, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called the comments about the Obamas racist, ugly and reprehensible.

Paladino made the comments Friday in response to an Artvoice survey that asked local artists, performers and business owners for their New Years wish list.

Asked what he would most like to happen in 2017, Paladino responded that he hoped Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a cow, dies and is buried in a cow pasture. 

Asked who he would like to see go away, he said Michelle Obama. 

Id like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla, he wrote. 

In an emailed statement to the AP, Paladino, 70, claimed his comments had nothing to do with race but instead reflected his opinion of the presidents performance in office. 

Merry Christmas and tough luck if you dont like my answer, he wrote. 

As recently as August, Paladino falsely claimed Mr. Obama was not Christian, telling the New York Observer that to average Americans, There is no doubt he is a Muslim. 

And in 2010, Paladino was criticized after it was revealed he had forwarded to friends racially charged emails that depicted Mr. Obama as a pimp. 

Paladino made no mention of any computer mistakes in a statement he released Friday after the publication posted his comments on its website. Instead, that statement ripped the Obamas, calling the president a yellow-bellied coward and claiming the first lady hated America before her husband won the White House.",2

Despite Mr. Trumps assertion that he has given millions of dollars to the Trump Foundation, news reports have indicated that Mr. Trump vastly oversells his charitable giving. And since he has not released his tax returns, its impossible to verify how much money he has given to charity. 

According to the Washington Post, Mr. Trump has given only one traceable personal donation since 2008 -- for $10,000, to the Police Athletic League of New York City. As for the Trump Foundation, Mr. Trump has given $5.5 million to the group since its inception -- but has not contributed to it since 2008, meaning the organization has largely been funded by other people in recent years.

In addition, several reports have established that Mr. Trump used money from the foundation to help further his political interests. The Washington Post reported, for example, that Mr. Trump used foundation funds to settle legal disputes -- and even to buy two large portraits of himself, one of which hung on the wall of a Trump-owned golf resort. He paid a $2,500 fine to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) earlier this year after it was revealed that his foundation made a $25,000 political contribution that violated tax laws.

The series of tweets came just two days after Mr. Trump announced he would be shuttering the foundation in the wake of questions about possible conflicts of interest.

Mr. Trump said in a Christmas Eve statement that he has directed his counsel to begin taking steps toward dissolving the foundation; however, it cannot formally shut down until the New York state attorney generals office completes its investigation of the foundation.

To avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways, Mr. Trump said in his statement.

Mr. Trumps tweets about the Trump Foundation also came just hours after he insisted on Twitter that there was no way President Obama could have beaten him in a hypothetical 2016 election between the two men, and criticized the United Nations for not living up to its great potential.",2
"86","1010.txt","Israel claims ""ironclad"" proof that the Obama administration was behind U.N. rebuke","JERUSALEM - Doubling down on its public break with the Obama administration, a furious Israeli government on Tuesday said it had received ironclad information from Arab sources that Washington actively helped craft last weeks U.N. resolution declaring Israeli settlements illegal.

The allegations further poisoned the increasingly toxic atmosphere between Israel and the outgoing Obama administration in the wake of Fridays vote, and raised questions about whether the White House might take further action against Israeli settlements in its final weeks in office.

With the U.S. expected to participate in an international peace conference in France next month and Secretary of State John Kerry planning a final policy speech, the Palestinians said they were hoping to capitalize on the momentum from the Security Council vote.

The U.N. vote's impact on U.S.-Israel relations
Although the U.S. has long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied lands, it has traditionally used its veto in the U.N. Security Council to protect its ally Israel from international censure. But in a change of policy, it abstained from Fridays vote, allowing the resolution to pass by a 14-0 margin.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long had a cool relationship with President Barack Obama, has called the resolution shameful and accused the U.S. of playing a leading role in its passage.

On Tuesday, his spokesman went even further.

We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage, David Keyes said.

Were not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night as the Obama administration helps push such a grave resolution, he said.

How U.N. resolution against Israel will impact U.S. relations
He did not identify the Arab sources or say how Israel obtained the information. Israel has close security ties with Egypt, an original sponsor of last weeks resolution. Under heavy Israeli pressure, Egypt delayed the resolution last week before other council members presented it for a vote a day later. Egypt ended up voting in favor of the measure.

Keyes claim mirrors that of his boss Netanyahu, who told his Cabinet on Sunday: From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed.

Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians, with overwhelming world support, claim for their state.   

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the U.S. abstention, saying, We would not have let this resolution pass if it hadnt addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians. And she added that the vote does not in any way diminish the United States steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.  

Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state, which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace, CBS News Margaret Brennan reports. 

The United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades, Power said.

Israels recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in Netanyahus hand: the incoming Trump Administration. 

In a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines, Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a U.S. veto. After the vote, Trump vowed that things will be different after Jan. 20th. 

Critically, he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements, his longtime attorney David Friedman, as ambassador to Israel. And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which even many Israelis fear could spark violence. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites, as the capital of the future state to which they aspire. 

After Fridays vote, Netanyahus office said he looked forward to working with Trump to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.   

It remains unclear what Trump might be able to do. While he will be able to wield the U.S. veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council, mustering enough votes to overturn Fridays decision appears to be impossible. 

The basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions, which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country. Israel has said the law doesnt apply because the territory was captured from Jordan, which has renounced all claims to the land. Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds. 

When Netanyahus rivals in Israel oppose the settlements, it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand, but rather for concern for Israels democracy. If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank, it will have to grant its 2.5 million Palestinians voting rights, or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy. 

The country is toxically divided on the issue, and key sectors of society, including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment, want to see settlements end. Many of them welcome - some openly, and many more quietly - any world pressure to bring that about. 

Dan Miodownik, a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University, said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution. 

He said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps, meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal. And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past, Israel was no longer being forced to defend its right to exist.  ",2

The Trump foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete, said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

The statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. 20.

But the foundations inner workings have been the subject of Schneidermans investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trumps incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from Trumps global business empire during his presidency.

Trumps charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.

President-elect announces he will shutter Trump Foundation
The admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were in a 2015 tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties.

The 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. 18 by someone using an email address from the foundations law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci.

In the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing doesnt provide details on the violations.

Schneiderman, a Democrat, launched his investigation into the charity after reporting by The Washington Post drew attention to some of the foundations purchases.

Trump asserted on Twitter late Monday that his foundation was run efficiently.

He said he isnt aware of any similar blanket questions posed to the Labor Department.

President-elect Trump has nominated businessman Andy Puzder to replace Perez as head of the Labor Department. Puzder is CEO of CKE restaurants which owns the fast food chains Hardees and Carls Jr. He has argued against raising the minimum wage.

Perez is now running for Chair of the Democratic National Committee. He criticized the Democratic Party for neglecting Rust Belt states, where Mr. Trump trounced Hillary Clinton.

Organizing cant consist of going to a church every four years in October and saying vote for me, Perez said.

President Obama nominated Perez as Labor Secretary in 2013. Perez championed Mr. Obamas efforts to expand overtime pay to millions of Americans. A Texas judge blocked a Labor Department rule expanding overtime in November. But Perez is promising to focus on similar efforts if elected DNC Chair.

You dont have to lower wages in order to move forward. You can lift wages and lift prosperity for everybody.

Perez faces Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellisona favorite of some progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermonts Sen. Bernie Sanders (I). Other names of potential DNC Chair challengers are also being floated.

Ellison is pushing to strengthen what he calls the grassroots of the party.

We have got to just make sure the Democratic rank-and-file really owns the party, feels that it is theirs, Ellison told Face the Nation moderator John Dickerson.

Some Republicans would revise and rebrand Obamacare,  junking unpopular provisions like its requirement that most Americans carry health insurance, while preserving well-liked parts. Others would rip up the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and not replace it.

 Can Congress put aside differences in the new year?

Can Congress put aside differences in the new year?
President-elect Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders will have to unite the groups on complicated changes affecting the financial and physical well-being of millions of people. For some constituents in fragile health, its literally a life-and-death debate.

Republicans have a really narrow path, says Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, a free-market health care research organization. Theyve got to deal with the politics of this, theyve got to make sure they come up with good policy, and they also have process challenges.

Success is not guaranteed, and Republicans may come to regret that their party defined itself as totally opposed to Obamacare.

Yet House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady seems unfazed by the challenge. Its like tax reform, says Brady, a Texas Republican, explaining that many pieces will be pulled together. Unlike Obamacare, which ripped up the individual market, this will be done deliberately, in an appropriate timetable.

Republicans say they will move quickly to repeal the ACA, while suspending the effective date to allow them to craft a replacement. Heres a look at the GOP camps and whos in them:

Revise and rebrand

Many Republicans may quietly be in this contingent, but fear being accused of promoting Obamacare-lite.

Theyd strip out some of the ACAs taxes and requirements. The unpopular individual mandate to carry health insurance or risk fines could be replaced with other persuasion short of a government dictate. Rules on insurers would be loosened.

But popular provisions such as protecting those with pre-existing health conditions would be retained in some form, as well as financial assistance for low- and moderate-income people. The requirement that health plans cover adult children until age 26 would be fairly easy to preserve, since employers have accommodated it.

A rebranded version of Obamas law may well cover fewer people. But its GOP advocates believe most Americans will find their goal of universal access to care politically acceptable when measured against the Democratic ideal of universal coverage, underwritten by government.

Many GOP allies in the business community favor revising the ACA. That includes major players among hospitals, insurers and pharmaceuticals.

Trump may have given this group some cover by saying that he wants to keep parts of the law, but his bottom line remains unknown.

Budget hawks

 For budget hawks, unwinding the Obama health law is a beginning. Next they could move on to much bigger objectives like restructuring Medicaid and Medicare, and placing a cost-conscious limit on tax breaks for employer coverage.

Budget hawks see health care as the main driver of government deficits, and they are loath to address that imbalance by raising taxes. Instead they want to rewrite the social compact so individuals accept more responsibility and risk for their health care.

House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is the most prominent member of this camp, and his Better Way agenda is its roadmap. Georgia Rep. Tom Price, Trumps nominee for Health and Human Services, is a budget hawk. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has been in the same orbit throughout his career.

The problem for budget hawks is that the 2016 political campaign did not give them a mandate. Issues like Medicare and Medicaid were scarcely discussed. Trump said he wouldnt cut Medicare, and sent conflicting signals on Medicaid.

Many Democrats cant wait for Republicans to follow the call of the budget hawks. Betting that will backfire, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is rallying her lawmakers against attacks on the ACA and Medicare.

The rip-it-up society

 The most conservative lawmakers want to pull Obamacare up by the roots as if it never existed, says Republican political consultant Frank Luntz. That sentiment is embodied by the 40 or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, and its probably broadly shared among conservatives.

Some do not believe the federal government should be involved in health care, and they couldnt care less about replacing the ACA.

They would say that Obamas plan has failed, said Luntz.

GOP leaders may need these lawmakers to advance on replacement legislation; coaxing them to a middle ground might not be possible.

Trump calls the ACA a disaster, and thats pleasing to those farthest on the right. Its unclear if hed walk their walk.

Pragmatists 

At the core of this small group are legislative veterans who understand the excruciating difficulties of getting major bills to a presidents desk. GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine are pragmatists.

They may find support from Republican governors who expanded Medicaid under the health law. GOP congressional leaders could gravitate to this camp.

The biggest challenge for pragmatists will be to win over some Democrats for replacement legislation. While repealing most of Obamacare is possible with a simple majority in the Senate, 60 votes would probably be needed for a replacement. There will only be 52 GOP senators next year.

Republicans need a fancy Rose Garden repeal ceremony...and I expect them to have one, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of the consulting firm Avalere Health. On the other hand, theres 20 million people with health insurance under the ACA, and they dont want to dump them. Theres no clear path for how to square that conflict.",2

Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation; N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back
And in doing so, Trump incorrectly stated the charitable reach of the Donald J. Trump Foundation.

In a series of tweets Monday evening, Trump said he had given millions to the foundation he began in 1987 and that all of the money raised went to ""wonderful charities.""

The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016
But extensive reporting over the past year has shown those claims to be overstated. According to the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, who has researched the foundation's donations and expenses for several months, Trump and his companies have given about $6 million to the charity since its launch, according to tax records up to 2015.

However, the president-elect has not given anything to the foundation from 2009 until 2014; his businesses gave to the foundation in 2015 for the first time in several years, according to the Post.

In fact, the two largest donors were professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5 million to the foundation from 2007 until 2009. Trump has nominated Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration.

And as Fahrenthold reported during the campaign, not all of the money was solely for charitable purposes. In many cases, spending benefited Trump and his business interests. Trump used his foundation's money to buy a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself for $20,000, and had earlier bought another portrait for $10,000, the Post's reporting showed. He also used the foundation's money to buy an autographed Tim Tebow Denver Broncos helmet for $12,000.

Trump tapped his foundation to help settle lawsuits for his businesses. In one case, Palm Beach, Fla., agreed to forgive fines for Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club if he made a $100,000 donation to a veterans' charity. In another instance, Trump settled a case involving one of his New York golf courses to make a $158,000 donation to a charity of the plaintiff's choosing.

""So if Trump is using this money basically to save his businesses, the money isn't helping people. That's a violation of the letter and the spirit of law,"" Fahrenthold told NPR's All Things Considered on Sunday.

Trump announced on Christmas Eve that ""to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.""

But Trump cannot shutter the foundation just yet since it's under investigation by the New York attorney general, according to the office's spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York in October, saying it wasn't registered by law to be able to do so in the state.

And last year Trump had to pay a $2,500 fine to the IRS when he used $25,000 of the foundation's money to donate to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was weighing whether or not to pursue an investigation into Trump University; ultimately, she decided not to, and this year was a vocal surrogate for Trump.

RealClearPolitics also reported in October that many of the Trump Foundation's donations in recent years went to top conservative or policy groups that could aid Trump as he prepared for a White House run.

'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation

'Saving Lives' Or 'Selling Access'? Explaining The Clinton Foundation
Throughout the campaign, Trump took sharp aim at his opponent Hillary Clinton's own family foundation, claiming it was a pay-to-play vehicle for the Democratic nominee and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office,"" Trump said at an August rally in Texas. ""They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money."" Those claims have not been borne out by evidence.

In August, the Clintons vowed to drastically reduce the size of their foundation to avoid appearances of conflict. They denied any insinuation of pay-to-play and defended the work of the Clinton Foundation.

At the time, RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, ""If everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said, then why change a thing?""

But now it's Trump and his family who have come under fire for some of the same alleged behaviors. An AP investigation found that Trump's son Eric "" has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity's payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump's private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships.""

My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with...

my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!

Eric Trump announced last week he would also close his personal foundation after it was auctioning off a coffee with his sister, Ivanka, who is expected to have considerable influence in her father's White House. The president-elect also tweeted about that last Friday, saying it was a ""ridiculous shame"" that Eric would have to stop fundraising for his foundation, which gave much of its money to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.


Back in October, NPR's Joel Rose compared the Trump and Clinton foundations and found some marked differences. While the Clinton Foundation does have hundreds of employees and a large budget, it spent almost 90 cents of every dollar received on charitable causes, such as HIV and malaria prevention in Africa. It's a public charity, meaning it mostly raises money from other people and organizations (including a gift from the Trump Foundation in 2009). And while it did accept money from foreign donors, some of whom wanted meetings when Clinton was secretary of state, ""there's no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the State Department,"" Rose reported.

The Trump Foundation is a private foundation, originally intended to give away Trump's own money. But, as noted earlier, he stopped making personal contributions about eight years ago.

""The Trump Foundation has engaged in documented, flagrant acts of violation,"" said Pamela Mann, a former head of the charities bureau in the New York attorney general's office, told Rose. ""That's really different.""",2

President-elect Donald Trump plans to dissolve his foundation, his transition team announced on in statement on Saturday.

Soon after, though, the New York attorney general's spokesperson tweeted that he legally can't, until the state's investigation of the Trump Foundation is complete.

.@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Foundation still under investigation by @AGSchneiderman, cannot legally dissolve until investigation complete
 Amy Spitalnick (@amyspitalnick) December 24, 2016
Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick was responding to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who asked if the investigation would continue.

In October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York, saying the charity was not registered to do so under state law.

In Saturday's statement, Trump is quoted as saying:

""The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children. However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.""
The announcement comes shortly after a report from The New York Times discussing the president-elect's many potential conflicts of interest. The Times reports that Trump and his family ""are rushing to resolve potential controversies  like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals  even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist.""

An NPR report from earlier this year compared the work of the Trump Foundation with that of the Clinton Foundation, which came under fire during the campaign, noting the similarities seem to end with their names. As NPR's Joel Rose reported, ""The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as it's formally known, is huge. It has hundreds of employees and a $90 million budget. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, by contrast, is fairly small. It has no full-time employees and a budget of about $600,000.""

In an interview with NPR's Allison Aubrey Sunday, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold provided context.

""The Donald J. Trump Foundation has been around since the late '80s, and on paper it sort of looks like what a lot of other rich people have, which is a foundation that's set up to give Trump's money away. But it's actually not that at all  for many of the recent years between 2009 and 2015, it didn't actually get any money from Trump at all  instead he gave away other people's money kind of under his own name, to people that thought they were getting Trump's money. He also used it to apparently violate the law in a number of ways  he used it to buy big portraits of himself including one that hangs on the wall of a sports bar he owns, and he used it to pay off debts or obligations that his businesses have incurred. So he was already under investigation by the New York Attorney General for apparently violating a number of federal laws that govern charities.""
David Fahrenthold's reporting in the Post has shown that Trump hasn't given any of his own money to the foundation since 2008. The Post says Vince and Linda McMahon, owners of World Wrestling Entertainment, have been major donors; Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration.",2

""There's nothing out of the ordinary here,"" Putin said, since the U.S. president-elect had advocated a stronger military throughout his election campaign.

The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016
Putin took a deep dive into U.S. politics on Friday during his annual news conference in Moscow, praising Trump and skewering President Obama and Hillary Clinton. During a marathon Q&A session that lasted almost four hours, reporters kept returning to the accusations of Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election. Putin took them on with gusto, at times sounding like a Trump surrogate.

""The current administration and the Democratic Party leadership are trying to blame all their failures on external factors,"" Putin said.

The Russian president said he agreed with Trump that anybody  even someone lying on their sofa  could have hacked the Democratic National Committee. The most important thing, according to Putin, is the information that came out of the hack, namely the machinations among top Democrats.

America's ""ruling party,"" he said, has clearly forgotten the original meaning of the word ""democratic.""

The fact that a growing number of Republicans has a favorable view of Putin shows that a ""significant portion"" of Americans shares the concerns and ""traditional values"" of Russians, Putin said, adding that mutual sympathy could be the basis for closer relations in the future.

He took issue with Obama's assertion last week that late Republican President Ronald Reagan ""would roll over in his grave"" because of Putin's popularity in the GOP. On the contrary, Putin said, Reagan would be happy that Republicans are winning everywhere and had Trump, who understood the mood of the people.

""He went all the way, even though only we believed that he would win,"" Putin said to laughter and applause.

On Friday, Trump said in a statement that he received ""a very nice letter"" from Putin, adding that ""his thoughts are so correct.""

In an indication that he's through with Obama, Putin said it's more likely that great Democrats are turning over in their graves. Unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who united Americans, the outgoing administration divided them, Putin said.

Even as he insisted on Russia's inability to sway the U.S. elections, Putin didn't hesitate to criticize the ""archaic nature"" of the Electoral College.

What he didn't mention is that Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.",2
"94","1018.txt","Trump Team Asks State Dept. To Name Those Working On Gender Equality","President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has asked the State Department to list its workers who focus on gender equality and ending violence against women, in what's being seen as an echo of an earlier request for the Energy Department to list employees who work on climate change.

In a brief email that was sent Wednesday morning, the Trump team asked the State Department's bureaus and offices to list any programs or activities that ""promote gender equality, such as ending gender-based violence, promoting women's participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc.""

The email was acquired and published by The New York Times, which reports:

""Although the wording of the memo is neutral and does not hint at any policy change, it rattled State Department employees, even those at senior levels. Some officials said they feared that the incoming Trump administration was trying to determine what programs were focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, though the memo did not refer to them.""
The team also asked the department offices to ""note positions whose primary functions are to promote such issues"" and to highlight any funds for the current financial year that are ""already allocated to such programs and activities.""

Affirming the Times' characterization of the email's reception, The Los Angeles Times quotes a senior State Department official who said, ""People are freaked out.""

Update 9 a.m. ET Friday: Trump Team's Response

In a statement about the request, the Trump transition team says:

""President-elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected. To help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality, ends gender-based violence, and promotes economic and political participationfinding ways to improve them, along with hundreds of other requests.""
Our original post continues:

The topic also came up at Thursday's daily State Department briefing  but NPR's Michele Kelemen says it seemed that spokesman John Kirby mainly sought to calm nerves about the request.

In a report for our Newscast unit, Michele quotes Kirby as saying, ""To the degree that there is interest in the way that we have approached pursuing gender equality and human rights around the world by the transition team, we will certainly provide them the context, the information that is appropriate for them to make their own decisions going forward.""

Kirby acknowledged that there could be ""anxiety"" at a time of transition, but he refused to go into details about the email or to verify the accuracy of the leaked documents.

Addressing his agency's approach to gender issues, Kirby told a reporter, ""Obviously, gender equality issues here at the Department of State are a priority. Secretary Kerry has made them a priority; Secretary Clinton before him made it a priority, and it remains one for us here.""

Kirby also suggested that the State Department might balk at naming its employees who have worked on those priorities, saying that in a hypothetical case, ""if there were issue-specific names requested, obviously that would be of concern to us and it would not be the kind of information that we would deem to be appropriate to be passed along.""

Shortly after the transition team's email became public, the Twitter account of the State Department's Political-Military Affairs bureau posted a note of support for the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, & Security  a program that was celebrated in a State Department tweet Wednesday, as the agency marked five years since the plan was introduced by President Obama.

In response to reports about the memo, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying in part:

""In light of previous requests made by the Trump transition team, today's report that the incoming administration is requesting all information related to State Department programs that promote gender equality is concerning and the transition team should clarify their intent.... Women and girls' equality is transformative for communities and economies, and the existing State Department programs have achieved great successes to advance education access for girls, protect women from trafficking, end child marriage, and combat gender-based violence.""
The Trump team's request, which set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon to produce the lists, comes one week after the Energy Department rebuffed a request from Trump's transition team to name employees working on climate change.

As NPR's Brakkton Booker has reported, the Trump team's 74-point questionnaire on climate change ""raised fears among civil rights lawyers specializing in federal worker whistleblower protections, who say the incoming administration is at a minimum trying to influence or limit the research.""

In refusing the Trump team's request, the Energy Department said many of its staff members were ""unsettled"" by the gesture, stating that while it would share any information that was already public, it would not produce a list of individual names.

Early last week, Trump said he is nominating Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department.",2
"95","113.txt","In Reversal, Gambian President Rejects Loss And Calls For New Election","After publicly conceding electoral defeat last week, President Yahya Jammeh of Gambia has reversed course and is calling for a new election.

Jammeh has ruled the tiny West African country since seizing power in a coup in 1994, and his public concession to President-elect Adama Barrow on Dec. 2 led to hopes of the first peaceful transition of power in Gambia since it became independent from the U.K. in 1965.

On Friday, Jammeh said the Independent Electoral Commission made errors in vote tallies.

""In the same way that I accepted faithfully the results, believing that the IEC was independent and honest and reliable, I hereby reject the results in totality,"" Jammeh said in a televised speech.

He also said there were other irregularities and problems in the electoral process.

""Our investigations reveal that in some cases, voters were told that the opposition has already won and there was no need for them to vote,"" Jammeh said.

Last week, supporters of the opposition took to the streets to celebrate Barrow's win. Jammeh's allegations are now ""plunging Gambia into confusion and uncertainty,"" NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports.

President-elect Barrow responded, telling reporters, ""The outgoing president has no constitutional authority to reject the result of the election and order for fresh elections to be held,"" Reuters reports. ""I urge him to change his current position and accept the verdict of the people in good faith for the sake of the Gambia, our homeland, whose people deserve peace and freedom and prosperity,"" he added to The Associated Press.

The U.S. joined international bodies in condemning the announcement.

""This action is a reprehensible and unacceptable breach of faith with the people of The Gambia and an egregious attempt to undermine a credible election process and remain in power illegitimately,"" State Department spokesman Mark C. Toner said in a press release.

The Economic Community of West African States, the U.N. and African Union echoed the sentiment in a joint statement:

""They call on the government of The Gambia to abide by its constitutional responsibilities and international obligations. It is fundamental that the verdict of the ballots should be respected, and that the security of the president -elect Adama Barrow, and that of all Gambian citizen be fully ensured.""

Wire services report the streets of the capital Banjul were calm Saturday, with a heavy presence of police and soldiers. Gambians closed down shops and stayed home out of fear of violence.

Human rights groups have criticized Jammeh for abuses during his 22-year rule. In its 2016 report, Human Rights Watch said his government ""frequently committed serious human rights violations including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture against those who voiced opposition to the government,"" creating ""a climate of fear within Gambia.""

On Saturday, the organization retweeted a statement from deputy program director Babatunde Olugboji saying they were ""deeply concerned.""

Diplomats told Reuters that it's unclear what international organizations plan to do, but there is a precedent for military intervention. In 1981, they note, the surrounding country of Senegal sent in troops to stop a coup in Gambia.

Opposition leader Mai Ahmad Fatty urged calm. ""We are working round the clock to restore sanity,"" he told the AP. ""We have the full support of our people. The world is with us.""",2
"96","115.txt","No Government Shutdown: Senate Passes Funding Bill After Democrats Back Down","Senate Democrats dropped their objections Friday night to a short-term-funding bill to keep the government running, and the bill passed less than an hour before the midnight deadline.

It's become a familiar year-end act for Congress: passing a short-term-funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This funding measure, which passed 63-36, runs out in April.

Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners.

The stopgap includes $45 million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia's Joe Manchin, wanted a full-year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months.

""Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""But we'll be back at it in April, and I think it's highly unlikely that we'll take it away.""

With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday  and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations  Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown.

The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April 28. Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly $1 trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs.

The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year 2017 spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year.

Since the spending bill is a must-pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis.

For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven-year cooling-off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in 2013.

Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process.

The measure also includes just over $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

An additional $4.1 billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew.

Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some $170 million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children.

Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as $352 million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and $500 million to states to combat the opioid epidemic.

The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010.",2
"97","120.txt","Preexisting Conditions and Republican Plans to Replace Obamacare","As debate about Obamacares future moves from peoples general, mostly partisan views of the Affordable Care Act to details and consequences of plans to repeal and replace the ACA, one of the biggest flash points is likely to be how people with pre-existing medical conditions are affected.

Across the U.S., people who have cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or other serious conditions will want to know whether they or their sick family members will be able to get and afford coverage in the future. Their partisan views about Obamacare are likely to quickly be supplanted by these more practical concerns. And a substantial number of people could be affected.

A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis to be released next week found that almost 30% of U.S. adults younger than 65 have health conditions that would have left them uninsurable in a pre-ACA world. Many more people have conditions with which they could still qualify for coverage before ACA protections took effectbut only at premiums they could not afford. Many people with conditions over which coverage could be declined before the ACA live in big red states (there are more than 4 million in Texas, for example) and in blue states (nearly 6 million in California). As the chart above shows, however, the 11 states with the largest shares of adults who have pre-existing conditions are all controlled by Republicans, and most are in the South. These states have higher rates of residents with conditions over which coverage was declined before the ACA, such as obesity and diabetes.

Still, even more Americans may feel that they have a stake in policies regarding pre-existing conditions. Kaisers monthly health tracking poll found in August that 53% of Americans said that they or a family member had a pre-existing condition after being read a definition of the term. Most people with pre-existing conditions are insured at any given time through employer plans or public programs such as Medicaid. Before the ACA, however, they would have been unable to get coverage again if they lost their insurance through a change in circumstances. Because so many people with a pre-existing condition have to worry about whether their circumstances might change someday, a much larger share of the public is likely to be interested in this issue than the number of people who stand to be affected immediately by policy changes.

President-elect Donald Trump has said that he wants to protect people who have pre-existing medical conditions. Details of Republican health-care plans are not yet known, but they are expected to involve establishing high-risk pools within states, among other measures. Without the plan details it is hard to say how strong protections will be.

Tens of millions of people with pre-existing medical conditions and the influential groups that represent them will be interested in details of legislative plans to change the ACA and how they might be affected. Its sometimes said that this has become a post-factual world. But as health care moves from a campaign issue to the legislative agenda, people will want to know how changes would affect them, and details and facts will matter more again.

"98","122.txt","Rand Paul Gives Glimpse of Trouble Trump May Face With His Party Over Government Spending","Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave an indication today of the trouble that President-elect Trump may face from his own party in trying to fulfill campaign promises that cost money.

The former GOP presidential candidate said on ABC News' ""This Week"" that he ""won't vote for a budget that never balances"" and that he is working to find a few other conservative GOP senators to join him.

""The current budget that the Republicans are looking at never balances. How can that be fiscally responsible? And how can we look at the public with a straight face and say, yes, we ran on balanced budgets, we're for the balanced budget amendment, and yet the budget we're going to introduce, that we're going to repeal Obamacare with never balances?"" Paul said.

Trump this week repeated his promise that he wants a trillion-dollar infrastructure program and he promised during the campaign to repeal Obamacare.

Paul said that with the help of other conservative senators he might be able to block a budget that he considers irresponsible.

""All it takes is a couple of us. If there are a few conservatives in the Senate wing of the Republican Party that will say no to a budget that never balances, we could have the power to say to the leadership, you know what, we need a better budget,"" Paul said.

""I don't know if it will happen, but I know that I will be one that won't vote for a budget that never balances,"" he said.

Paul also addressed reports that ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson has emerged as a likely pick for secretary of state, saying that he is ""going to reserve judgment on Tillerson.""

But the Kentucky senator had strong warnings about former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who is a possible contender for secretary of state or deputy secretary of state.

""I'll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his world view is naive,"" Paul said. ""He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War. He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran.""

"99","126.txt","Brexit Uncertainties Threaten Brain Drain for UK Science","Like many foreign scientists in Britain, Joanna Bagniewska was devastated when Britons voted to leave the European Union. The biology lecturer, a Polish migrant who found Britain a welcoming place to build her academic career over a decade, is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the air.

""I'm worried that after my current contract finishes, one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card,"" she said. ""I'd like to apply for EU grant money, but how much longer will it be available for?""

Britain's top universities have long been among the world's most sought-after destinations for study and research, drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. But since Britons voted in June to leave the 28-nation EU, many in the science community say the U.K. risks losing the money, the international influence  and crucially, the talent  to sustain that enviable position.

More than one-tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years. Some fields  such as nanotechnology and cancer research  are more dependent on EU funding than others, according to a report by technology firm Digital Science. From 2007 to 2013, Britain received 8.8 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in direct EU investment in research.

Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself  she's upset for her students' future too, for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted.

""They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph.Ds in other countries. And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled,"" she said.

Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries. The bloc's freedom of movement means its 500 million people can live and work visa-free in any member state.

No one knows yet what form Britain's exit from the EU  commonly known as Brexit  is going to take, but immigration was a key issue for ""Leave"" voters. Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain.

Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders. She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain, an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the 32,000 Europeans who make up 16 percent of the academic workforce in British universities. Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield.

Scientists for EU, an advocacy group, says it has received over 400 letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work. Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers. Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold. One said their employer, a London university, immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze, citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income.

Adam Durrant, a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers, says he's now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain. Part of the reason, he says, is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before.

""In the future, it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U.K. to work,"" said Durrant. ""There's a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future. I will certainly retain a U.K. presence, but my company's focus of gravity may shift elsewhere.""

Scientists say some U.K.-based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues.

Paul Crowther, head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield, said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum. The vote ""put the U.K.-based researchers in a very awkward position"" and their participation in EU-funded programs could ""compromise the project,"" he was told.

""The erosion of U.K. involvement in EU networks has already begun, with both the U.K. and EU science worse off,"" Crowther said.

Apart from a loss of grant money, Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure.

""Large-scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases, the building of large facilities, are areas that multinational collaborations do much better,"" said Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist and president of Britain's prestigious Royal Society.

The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain, which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science. In 2014, Britain's government spent under 0.5 percent of its GDP on research  below the European average, and half that of South Korea.

May's government is clearly aware of the jitters. She has promised to increase annual investment in research by 2 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2020, in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation.

Durrant is doubtful that's enough to make a big difference.

""Two billion a year spread across everything isn't going to go very far,"" he said.

Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level. The 125,000 European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans. Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year  but no one knows what will happen after that.

Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain's most competitive university courses, including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge. In September, the admission service UCAS reported a 9 percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in 2017.

Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland, an ""associate"" EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects.

""It's not all doom and gloom  but it will be harder,"" Ramakrishnan said. ""We could make a go of it outside the EU. But for that to happen, we have to attract talent and fund science. And those two things are critical.""",2
"100","128.txt","Contradicting settled science, Donald Trump says ""nobody really knows"" on climate change","Donald Trump said again on Sunday that he is open-minded about climate change -- but also that nobody really knows the truth about the issue, which contradicts the fact that there is near-universal scientific agreement on the issue.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday, moderator Chris Wallace pointed out to Mr. Trump  that in the space of a week he bothmet with former Vice President Al Gore and appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier who has opposed many environmental regulations, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Where, Wallace asked, does Mr. Trump stands on climate change?

Im very open-minded. Im still open-minded, he said. Nobody really knows.

However, there is a near-universal scientific consensus that climate change is a real phenomenon -- despite continued opposition to the notion among primarily Republican politicians. NASAs website on climate change, for example, notes that approximately 97 percent of publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are very likely responsible for rising temperatures.

His comments came just days after his transition team created a questionnaire with 74 questions for Energy Department officials to identify employees who had been involved in international climate talks over the last five years, as well as employees who have helped develop Obama administration climate policies.

The questionnaire, obtained by CBS News and first reported by Bloomberg News, asks, for example, Which programs within [the Department of Energy] are essential to meeting the goals of President Obamas Climate Action Plan?

Mr. Trumps answer Sunday on the climate change issue is similar to the one he gave in a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times last month -- after a campaign in which Mr. Trump repeatedly insisted climate change was a hoax invented by China.

I have a very open mind, he said at the time. And Im going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and were going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind.

Still, Mr. Trump said his reason for choosing Pruitt -- whom many environmental groups immediately blasted -- was to speed up the process for permit approvals and other EPA business.

If you look at what Chinas doing. If you look at what -- I could name country after country, he said. You look at whats happening in Mexico where our people are just -- plants are being built and they dont wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? They build it like the following day or the following week. We cant let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.

As for the Paris Agreement, the landmark international climate agreement that went into effect this fall, Mr. Trump said he is studying the agreement -- but that he worries it will put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage. International energy and environment experts worry that Mr. Trump, who said earlier this year that he would tear up the Paris deal, could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.

Paris, Im studying, he said. I do say this: I dont want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. And as you know, there are different times and different time limits on that agreement. I dont want that to give China, or other countries signing agreements an advantage over us.",2

His ascension from deputy prime minister follows the surprise resignation last week of John Key after eight years as prime minister. 

Key was a popular leader and was expected to contest a fourth straight election next year. But he said he wanted to leave while he was on top and to spend more time with his wife and two children. 

English, 54, has degrees in commerce and literature. He has been praised for his handling of the countrys economy in his role as finance minister. 

A practicing Roman Catholic, English has been a politician for 26 years, after he was first elected to the parliament in 1990. He had a previous unsuccessful stint as party leader, taking his party to a big election defeat in 2002. He said hes gained wisdom and experience since then. 

I was 39 years old then, with six children under 13, he said last week. So if nothing else, Ive got the opportunity to focus much more on the job now. 

Under English, New Zealand has been enjoying relatively robust annual GDP growth of more than 3 percent and the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent. English has also managed to return small surpluses on the governments books over the past couple of years. 

English said he will deliver tax cuts and spread the countrys growing wealth to where it is needed.",2
"102","137.txt","New push to replace Obamacare reignites old GOP tensions","Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obamas signature health-care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before President-elect Donald Trump is even sworn in.

But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the laws insurance would go away.

Hard-liners are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast.

While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years.

Id like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes, said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the repeal and replace efforts. We have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats wont help with anything.

Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)
Hatch and other high-ranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until 2019 or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections.

Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly.

I dont want to leave the 84,000 people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden, two-thirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy, Collins said.

But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues  many of them sent to Congress in the midterm, anti-Obama waves of 2010 and 2014  who see little reason to dawdle.

The history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that itll never get done, said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), elected recently as the new chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Republicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years?

Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their foot-dragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a terrific replacement that will provide great health care at a fraction of the cost.

The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacares sunset. But other fights loom  over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether Obamacares Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition.

The battle lines, however, are familiar, with establishment Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to retire.

Come Jan. 20, Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a health-care overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan. 3. But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets.

So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute.

Were going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. The number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people.

Hard-liners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trumps pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill with all deliberate speed but pledged only to then set into motion a process to replace it.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Republicans would move as well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people.

Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing.

The idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace, he said.

Conservative activists who pushed a take-no-prisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited.

When Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you dont wait, said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. Im a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. Thats it.

Democrats and many health-care experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than 12 million Americans are covered under those policies.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacares insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closed-door meeting.

Delayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states, Burwell told reporters after the meeting.

Republicans want to end Obamacares system of penalties and subsidies. But many  including Trump  want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick.

Experts warn that repeal and delay under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as $3 billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated.

That $3 billion is the tip of the iceberg, Blumberg said. With all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get.

Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers.

The insurance industry should understand that theres a new sheriff in town, said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Freedom Caucus member. They signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, theyre going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a free-market insurance industry.

The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic.

There will be a slim 52-to-48 Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require 60 votes.

Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan  and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so.

We all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all, Hatch said.

Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, has rejected that strategy. Were not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it, he told The Washington Post recently.

But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and well-organized activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction.

One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the repeal-and-replace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to 11,000 congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law.

I dont think anyone thinks that youre going to flip a switch .?.?. but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly, she said. We want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done.

Brandon was even blunter: This is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough [cookies], he said. Theyre going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? Its hard.

The political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place, he added. The old excuses of having divided government, theyre gone.

A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. They have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully theyll recognize that its not quite so simple, said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave.

But many others are not.

Literally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress, said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), a first-termer who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. Weve got to act on it.",2
"103","138.txt","Key GOP senators join call for bipartisan Russia election probe, even as their leaders remain mum","Two Senate Republicans joined demands for a bipartisan probe into Russias suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald Trump as questions continue to mount about the president-elects expected decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia.

Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.)  the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  joined calls by incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed (R.I.) for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U.S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIAs private conclusion that Russias activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump.

Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American, the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.

This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security, they added.

But McCain and Graham  who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election  have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a wide-ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), one of the more moderate Republicans in the upper chamber, suggested a bipartisan investigation may be useful toward achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries.

The purpose of any investigation, whether by the Obama administration or Congress, is not to question or relitigate the results of any past or present Presidential election, she said in a statement. Instead, any review must focus on the long overdue task of improving the defenses of the United States against cyber attacks, including those that might seek to affect or influence political campaign.

Another GOP senator  Sen. James Lankford (Okla.), who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee  agreed with McCain and Grahams decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U.S. elections.

Cybersecurity investigation of Russian interference cant be partisan, Lankford tweeted Sunday.

Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committees chairman, Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said Sunday that the panel will continue to conduct vigorous oversight of all intelligence matters.

But he made no specific mention of Russia, unlike Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said cyber threats by Americas rivals, including Russia, pose serious challenges that should not be politicized or viewed through a partisan lens.

Johnson said as chairman Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations panel he would continue to hold hearings based on fact  not innuendo  for the sole purpose of informing effective policy and appropriate countermeasures.

Republicans may be loath to join calls for such a wide-ranging investigation into Russias election-related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as ridiculous. They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the president-elect before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he praised during the campaign.

I think its just another excuse. I dont believe it .?.?. No, I dont believe it at all, Trump said of the CIA charges on Fox News Sunday. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway echoed her boss on CBSs Face the Nation, saying that such allegations from the intelligence community were laughable and ridiculous.

Trump also played down the importance of receiving the daily intelligence briefing, a tradition for presidents and presidents-elect. He has received the briefings only sporadically since winning the election.

A U.S. intelligence official said it is concerning that intelligence on Russia relating to the election is being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan.

The inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his number-two, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets  although some of them suggested Congresss review of Russian actions should broaden.

All this news of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news, Cornyn tweeted Saturday.

The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U.S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham: Cyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia  not just election influence.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters, calling foreign intervention unacceptable.

For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether  Putins government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clintons campaign.

At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about Trumps likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobils chief executive, as secretary of state due to his  ties to Putin. Republicans in a 52-to-48 Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson.

The potential nomination sparked a backlash among the partys traditional hawks who oppose Putin, and some senior strategists feared that more than a handful of Republicans would outright oppose his nomination  requiring Trump to find Democratic support in order to confirm his potential Secretary of State.

Its a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat, McCain told CBSs Face the Nation.

Being a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted Sunday.

Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Robert Menendez (N.J.) and Christopher A. Coons (Del.), stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate.

In a post on Facebook, Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state alarming and absurd, concluding that the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the Presidents Cabinet guiding our nations foreign policy.

Yet the committees chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)  who was considered a possible pick for Trumps secretary of state  has said Tillerson would be a good choice.

If it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual, Corker tweeted.

Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone. If Democrats stick together, Republicans must muster at least 50 of the 52 votes they will have to successfully confirm him, as Vice President-elect Mike Pence could cast the tiebreaking vote.

Graham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination.

I dont know the man much at all, but lets put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then were gonna have some talkin, Graham said early Saturday morning. Well have some questions. I dont want to prejudge the guy but thats a bit unnerving.",2
"104","139.txt","Trump says nobody really knows if climate change is real","President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that nobody really knows whether climate change is real and that he is studying whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, Trump said hes very open-minded on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obamas efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut Americas global competitiveness.

Im still open-minded. Nobody really knows, Trump said. Look, Im somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. Its not something thats so hard and fast. I do know this: Other countries are eating our lunch.

There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity  including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating and industrial manufacturing  is driving recent climate change. In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is extremely likely that, since the 1950s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the dominant cause of the planets warming trend. The top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal record-keeping began in 1880.

But its not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific view.

During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to climate change as a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, a comment he later described as a joke. But during a town hall in New Hampshire, he also mocked the idea of global warming. At that event, Meghan Andrade, a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters, asked Trump what he would do to address the issue, to which he replied: Let me ask you this  take it easy, fellas  how many people here believe in global warming? Do you believe in global warming?

After asking three times Who believes in global warming? and soliciting a show of hands, Trump concluded that nobody believed climate change was underway except for Andrade.

During Sundays interview with Wallace, Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their U.S. competitors.

If you look at what  I could name country after country. You look at whats happening in Mexico, where our people are just  plants are being built, and they dont wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? he said. They build it like the following day or the following week. We cant let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.

The U.S. has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the 2008 recession, though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates. Typically, economists compare the U.S. against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterparts.

The New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency, to which he has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt  a climate change skeptic  as the head. Wallace asked whether he was going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy, to which Trump replied, No. No. No. I dont want to do that at all.  I just want whats right.

EPA, you cant get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay?  he said. Thats why people dont want to invest in this country.

It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to, but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules. And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United States voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement, it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into force.


Last week Trumps transition team for the Energy Department asked officials there to identify which employees have participated in international climate negotiations or worked on domestic efforts to cut greenhouse gases, such as calculating the social cost of carbon. Several scientists, federal union officials and public watchdog groups have expressed concern that these individuals could be targeted for retaliation once Trump takes office.

"105","143.txt","Will Trump's plan mean faster rate hikes?","The Federal Reserve is virtually certain to raise interest rates this week for the first time this year, but the course of future hikes has suddenly become cloudier.

The Fed has signaled for many weeks that it plans to hoist its key rate by a quarter percentage point at a two-day meeting that begins Tuesday, and futures markets say theres a 93% chance it will follow through.

Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trumps fiscal stimulus proposals may ultimately require faster rate increases to head off inflation, while other byproducts of his plan could slow the economy and prompt the Fed to act more cautiously.

For now, economists dont expect Fed policymakers to weigh such hypotheticals as they draft their quarterly projections for rate increases over the next few years. Even so, with unemployment falling rapidly and inflation finally picking up, Fed officials likely are no longer inclined to call for slower rate hikes over the long-term, as they have in each of their previous forecasts this year amid headwinds such as weak productivity growth, economists say.


Unemployment is falling toward levels that are arguably below stable inflation, says Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor and author of the Fedwatch blog.  Yet he says the Fed will almost certainly reiterate that rate increases will be gradual.

In November, the jobless rate dropped to 4.6% from 4.9% the previous month. Thats already below the 4.8% that the Fed has deemed the lowest average rate sustainable without generating excessive inflation, or rapid price increases that decrease consumers' purchasing power and especially hurt savers and those on fixed incomes. Low unemployment typically pushes up wages as employers compete for fewer available workers, and price increases typically follow as the firms scramble to maintain profit margins.

That doesnt mean persistently low inflation is poised to suddenly spike.While an inflation measure closely monitored by the Fed rose from 1.2% to 1.4% annually in October as the effects of low gasoline prices faded, thats well below the Feds 2% target.

Still, it was the fastest pace in two years. And annual wage growth hit a seven-year high in October and has climbed steadily since early 2015 in a further signal that inflation is firming, Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients.

In September, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that discouraged workers on the sidelines were streaming back into the labor force, keeping the unemployment rate elevated and providing the economy more room to run without stoking inflation. But the labor force shrank in both October and November, giving the Fed another reason to make a move this week and stick with its previous forecast of two rate hikes next year and three in 2018.

If you were to wait any longer, you would risk getting behind the curve, says JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli. The Fed held off on rate increases earlier this year in response to Chinas slowdown and a sluggish U.S. economy, among other factors.

The future roadmap is fuzzier. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion plan to upgrade the nations infrastructure and sharp tax cuts, a stimulus package that, if passed by Congress, could fuel inflation and force the Fed to lift rates more rapidly.

But, Its probably too early for the Fed to incorporate any fiscal policy issues into their forecast, Duy says. Its similarly too soon, he says, to anticipate  negative economic fallout from Trumps restrictive trade proposals.

On the other hand, the prospect of more federal spending and faster economic growth and inflation under Trump already has strengthened the dollar and pushed up long-term interest rates. Those developments tend to crimp the economy by hurting U.S. exports and discouraging consumer and business borrowing.

If they were to persist or intensify next year, the Fed may raise rates more gradually than anticipated, especially if the faster growth portended by Trumps plan hasnt yet materialized, Feroli says.",2

"107","151.txt","Trump's choice for education secretary raises fears in Detroit","Two years ago, Jonathan Clark was sending his four school-age kids to four different schools in Detroit.

We were driving 200 miles a week just to and from school, he said. His three oldest  all girls, ages 14 to 16  were enrolled at charters, privately run schools funded by the government that promise better educational outcomes.

Clark was able to send his kids to schools all over the city because of school choice, the policy that allows kids to get educated outside their home district. But Clark said the conditions at these charter schools were no different from whats typical of a public school in Detroit: a lack of resources needed to educate students, high teacher turnover, and low test scores.

These are all things they give bad marks to DPS [Detroit public schools] on, he said, but charters are doing the same.

Analysis Trump's cabinet looks increasingly conventional but far from moderate
Donald Trumps personnel picks have stayed within the Republican mainstream  few are Trump cronies, and some were even opponents of the president-elect
 Read more
Thats why Clark is alarmed by Donald Trumps nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the US Department of Education.

DeVos, a billionaire and conservative activist from the state, has been one of the strongest defenders in Michigan of expanding charter schools and choice.

DeVos and her husband, Dick, have long been a force in education policy efforts in Michigan, as well as other sensitive political issues  such as the Michigan legislatures 2012 decision to pass right-to-work legislation. The DeVoses have contributed at least $7m to state lawmakers and Michigans GOP party  including support for a failed $5m effort to pass a pro-school-voucher voter referendum in 2000.

Public education advocates who oppose DeVoss nomination point to Michigans education record  particularly in Detroit, where nearly half of students attend charters.

Since a quarter-century ago, charter advocates have pursued an agenda that has included a lift on the cap for how many can open in the state, as well as an expansion of school choice. Along the way, the states academic performance has dropped, and Detroit has probably felt the biggest impact.

Though charter advocates point to studies that suggest student gains have been made at charters, the citys disconnected array of schools has developed into a frenetic status quo. Just this year, the district has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, prompting teachers facing potential payless work days to stage mass protests, and a federal lawsuit is now attempting to assert a constitutional right to literacy  an argument couched in the dismal performance scores of Detroit students.

Whats more, the states policies and regulation of charters has been so lax, critics routinely refer to the citys educational landscape as the wild west. Indeed, a federal audit this year noted Michigans charter school law does not include provisions for regulating conflict-of-interest issues. The state also allows for-profit charters to be established, a practice prohibited elsewhere.

Since 1990, Detroits population has dropped nearly 35%, while its school districts attendance has plummeted nearly 75%  a signal of the proliferation of charters and use of choice in the city.

The situation in Michigan is such that even charter advocates criticize the states approach  and DeVoss devotion to maintaining it.

It doesnt matter that charter schools arent giving any of the things they promised 22 years ago, said Stephen Henderson, a Detroit native and editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, who, along with his two children, attended charters. She ... and her family funds any effort to block any changes or accountability or standards that would perhaps produce better results for us.

But the pick underscored the polarizing views of DeVos. In her home state, Michigans governor and attorney general echoed Trumps remarks about her qualifications.

Dan Quisenberry, president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies, downplayed criticisms of her background, saying her business experience and previous role as the Michigan GOP chairwoman showed she could lead a large organization and handle political issues.

Betsy is a person who will put kids before adults, he said. Shes going to put students and parents ahead of politics.

Michigan indeed has some high-performing charter schools, including in Detroit. Many supporters point to a 2013 Stanford study that found charter students in the state learned at a faster rate than those in public schools, with two months of gains, or three months in Detroit. Still, the study found that slightly more than half of Detroit charter schools failed to perform significantly better in math and reading than counterparts, some even worse.

This summer, charter school advocates  including DeVoss group, the Great Lakes Education Project  agreed to some additional accountability measures as part of a $617m investment to overhaul the governance of Detroit public schools. Schools must now be assessed regularly, and new schools accredited.

But a provision to create a commission overseeing Detroit schools was stripped from the legislation after intense lobbying by charter advocates and DeVos.

What they feared was the accountability, Henderson, 46, said.

DeVos  whose father-in-law founded Amway, a marketing company that previously settled tax fraud accusations for $25m  has long leveraged her wealth to target Republicans who have not boosted her education agenda. After the commission was derailed, DeVos donated $1.45m to state Republican lawmakers over a two month period.

Henderson said GOP lawmakers had told him that in the runup to the decision to axe the Detroit commission, DeVos explicitly stated that she wouldnt donate to their campaign efforts if they didnt flip their votes on the issue.

Trumps transition team declined to make DeVos available for an interview and did not provide comment for this story.

Quisenberry said critics  namely, teachers unions  who point to DeVos political influence usually are involved very much in the same influence on the other side

What the [Detroit commission] was about was whose political influence was going to win out, he said. The teachers union was very involved.

Clark believes the commission would have addressed the distribution and quality of of schools in the city - in his neighborhood, there is just one operational school for 3,000 kids.

If schools in our neighborhood were open, and up to standards, and producing a quality educational experience, then we wouldnt have had to go to four different schools all over the city, Clark said.

Clark now sends his three older kids to private school. But he knows that is off the table for many other parents in the city, where 40% of residents live below the poverty line.

What about the parents who arent in that position?",2
"108","154.txt","Rex Tillerson: an appointment that would confirm Putin's US election win","If Rex Tillerson is nominated as the next secretary of state, it would confirm Vladimir Putin as one of the strategic victors of the US presidential election.

Barack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign, which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump. But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome, a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for Moscow.

While the other leading candidates for the job hold largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia, the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin, who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013.

The Wall Street Journal reported: Friends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson.

The 64-year-old Texas oilman spent much of his career working on Russian deals, including a 2011 agreement giving Exxon Mobil access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant state-owned Russian oil company, OAO Rosneft, the opportunity to invest in Exxon Mobils operations overseas.

Tillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the mid-1990s. Sechin, sometimes described as the second-most-powerful man in Russia, is now under US sanctions. He has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson.

The 2011 Exxon-Rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it $1bn and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted.

Trumps choice suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it
Thomas Wright, Brookings Institution
We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions, he said, at a shareholders meeting.

In June, two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin, Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit.

If the sanctions were lifted, the Arctic project would probably go ahead and Tillersons retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value. He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department. It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career.

Trumps choice of Rex Tillerson suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it, said Thomas Wright, who has written extensively on Trumps foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.


Tillerson has a relationship with Putin and he opposed the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. This will alarm those worried about Russian intentions in Europe.

Praising Tillerson in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Trump said: To me a great advantage is that he knows many of the players in the world and he knows them well.

Lest there be any doubt about which players the president-elect had in mind, Trump added: He does massive deals in Russia not for himself, but for the company.

A culture of intimidation

In a very real sense, Tillerson has been a head of a state within a state. Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries. It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces.

As a state, it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin.

Reporting on Exxon was not only harder than reporting on the Bin Ladens, it was harder than reporting on the CIA by an order of magnitude, said Steve Coll, who wrote about the company in a book, Private Empire.

They have a culture of intimidation that they bring to bear in their external relations, and it is plenty understood inside the corporation too. They make people nervous, they make people afraid, Coll, now a journalism professor at Columbia University, told Texas Monthly.

Running the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil, however. For a start, Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate. On Saturday, leading Democrats were painting him as a Moscow stooge.

The New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said on Twitter: Rex Tillerson as secretary of state would guarantee Russia has a willing accomplice in the presidents cabinet.

With a slim 52-48 majority, it would only take three Republican senators in revolt to cast Tillersons job in doubt. He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks, led by John McCain.

I have obviously concerns about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer, but obviously we will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined and then its the time to make up your mind on whether to vote yes or no, the Arizona senator told CNN on Saturday.

A US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values would be a disaster for Russia
Andrei Kozyrev, former Russian foreign minister
McCains former chief of staff, Mark Salter, was far more blunt on Twitter. Tillerson would sell out Nato for Sakhalin oil and his pal, Vlad, he wrote. Should be a rough confirmation hearing, and a no vote on the Senate floor.

Even if Tillerson were to be confirmed, he would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy. He would face a striking culture clash with the institution, the bastion of foreign policy orthodoxy, which would have an ally in the secretary of defence nominee, retired general James Mattis, who is likely to oppose any erosion of Nato solidarity in the face of Moscows assertiveness in Europe.

Nevertheless, Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Endowment Moscow Center, argued: Tillerson as secretary of state would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the cold war.

Not just in US-Russian relations: a Trump-Tillerson foreign policy would be squarely focused on US national interests, rather than on its global pretensions or any ideology.

Trenin added: It would be hard-nosed and no-nonsense, not averse to the use of force, but in response to a real rather than imaginary threat. In one word: realist.

That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin, whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers, run by strongmen like himself.

Andrei Kozyrev, a former Russian foreign minister, argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for.

The paradoxical situation now is that Russia is hoping for a US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values, but that would be a disaster for Russia, said Kozyrev, who is now at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington.

Why? Because the only interest America has in ending the conflicts in eastern Ukraine  or in Syria is actually in American values  that America should be concerned and do everything to alleviate the humanitarian situation and they should help nations to find their path to democracy.

The realpolitik situation is that Russia is stuck in both military conflicts. If you look at this with a cold eye, you say: Let them go on and let them enjoy the disaster they have in eastern Ukraine, Kozyrev said.

Look at Syria. By realpolitik the Americans would rather sit and wait while Russia draws on its resources and gets into bloody conflict.",2
"109","155.txt","Intelligence figures fear Trump reprisals over assessment of Russia election role","Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to ensure Trumps victory.

Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus.

When the president-elects transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community [IC], it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts, Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told the Guardian.

Like his Democratic colleagues on the panel, Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference. Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators, mostly but not exclusively Democrats, who consider the Russia hack a national emergency.

It is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world. Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concerns.

One noted that civil-service laws prevented Trump from launching a purge, but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people who have attended climate change policy conferences.

Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month. Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus, picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new presidents attitudes toward the agencies.

There is not just smoke here. There is a 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid
Glenn Carle, former CIA officer
There is not just smoke here. There is a blazing 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid, and Trump is standing half-burnt and holding a match, said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer and interrogator.

The facts hurt, Trump wont like the truth, and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity.

After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election, Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidence.

On Friday, the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National Committees digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump, not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the election.

In response, Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments. His transition team said in a statement: These are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Trump cannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaign and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence.

If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now, and demean the hard-working and patriotic Americans who produced it, I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths, Schiff said.

Will he accept the best insights of our agencies, or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions?

Trumps clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles. Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus. Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in January.

Should Trump go through with the reshuffle, it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director of national intelligence, after James Clapper announced his resignation last month. Trump has also been noncommittal about retaining the FBI director, James Comey, whose bureau houses significant sympathy for Trump.

Congressional Republicans are in an uncomfortable position, between a president of their own party and Russia, a traditional adversary.

Devin Nunes, a California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was no surprise. He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of delusions of resetting relations with Russia  a policy that Trump is also pursuing.

On Sunday, anti-Trump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path, joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking, which they said endangered the country.

We have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society, the senators said in a joint statement.

Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.

 Trump: reports that Russia influenced US election are ridiculous
Also on Sunday, Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat on the investigations-heavy House oversight committee, pressured the Republican committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz, and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to join us now in our effort to launch a robust and truly bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in our election that puts our nations interests over the interests of any political party.

Carle, the retired CIA officer, said Trumps temperament had played into Russias hands and put the president-elect on a collision course with the CIA.

He said: Look, in my professional assessment as an intelligence officer, Trump has a reflexive, defensive, monumentally narcissistic personality, for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant, and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself.

He is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine. He groans with vulnerabilities. He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up, and he is a shockingly easy intelligence target to manipulate.

Were Trump an intelligence officer himself, Carle said, he would be removed and possibly charged with having accepted the clandestine support of a hostile power to the harm of the United States.

A senior intelligence official who was not cleared to talk to reporters supported the push to declassify additional material on the serious matter of the alleged Russian electoral interference, since it happened on our watch.",2
"110","157.txt","Ahead of Pro-Trump Rally, KKK Members Claim They're 'Not White Supremacists'","PELHAM, N.C.  In today's racially charged environment, there's a label that even the KKK disavows: white supremacy.

Standing on a muddy dirt road in the dead of night near the North Carolina-Virginia border, masked Ku Klux Klan members claimed Donald Trump's election as president proves whites are taking back America from blacks, immigrants, Jews and other groups they describe as criminals and freeloaders. America was founded by and for whites, they say, and only whites can run a peaceful, productive society.

But still, the KKK members insisted in an interview with The Associated Press, they're not white supremacists, a label that is gaining traction in the country since Trump won with the public backing of the Klan, neo-Nazis and other white racists.

""We're not white supremacists. We believe in our race,"" said a man with a Midwestern accent and glasses just hours before a pro-Trump Klan parade in a nearby town. He, like three Klan compatriots, wore a robe and pointed hood and wouldn't give his full name, in accordance with Klan rules.

Claiming the Klan isn't white supremacist flies in the face of its very nature. The Klan's official rulebook, the Kloran  published in 1915 and still followed by many groups  says the organization ""shall ever be true in the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy,"" even capitalizing the term for emphasis.

Watchdog groups also consider the Klan a white supremacist organization, and experts say the groups' denials are probably linked to efforts to make their racism more palatable.

Still, KKK groups today typically renounce the term. The same goes for extremists including members of the self-proclaimed ""alt-right,"" an extreme branch of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism.

""We are white separatists, just as Yahweh in the Bible told us to be. Separate yourself from other nations. Do not intermix and mongrelize your seed,"" said one of the Klansmen who spoke along the muddy lane.

The Associated Press interviewed the men, who claimed membership in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK, in a nighttime session set up with help of Chris Barker, a KKK leader who confirmed details of the group's ""Trump victory celebration"" in advance of the event. As many as 30 cars paraded through the town of Roxboro, North Carolina, some bearing Confederate and KKK flags.

Barker didn't participate, though: He and a Klan leader from California were arrested hours earlier on charges linked to the stabbing of a third KKK member during a fight, sheriff's officials said. Both men were jailed; the injured man was recovering.

The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, which monitor white extremist organizations and are tracking an increase in reports of racist incidents since the election, often use the ""white supremacist"" label when describing groups like the Klan; white nationalism and white separatism are parts of the ideology. But what exactly is involved?

The ADL issued a report last year describing white supremacists as ""ideologically motivated by a series of racist beliefs, including the notion that whites should be dominant over people of other backgrounds, that whites should live by themselves in a whites-only society, and that white people have their own culture and are genetically superior to other cultures.""

That sounds a lot like some of the ideas espoused by today's white radicals, yet they reject the label. That's likely because they learned the lessons of one-time Klan leader David Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana this year, said Penn State University associate professor Josh Inwood.

""(There was) this peddling of kinder, softer white supremacy. He tried to pioneer a more respectable vision of the Klan,"" Inwood said.",2
"111","159.txt","Democrats Hope Trump's Cabinet Picks Will Stand in Their Own Way","With Democrats unable to stop President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks on their own, they're hoping that increased scrutiny on his nominees will do it for them.

As the minority party in the Senate with little real recourse at their disposal, uncovering something disqualifying may be Democrats' last best hope to block some Trump selections that they view as unacceptable and outside the political mainstream.

Even if they don't have the votes to shoot down any nominees, Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings. They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves or try to shame them  all in the service of trying to peel off the three Republican votes they would need to kill a nomination or force the Trump White House to withdraw the pick.

Not all of Trump's picks will face such aggressive scrutiny, which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition. Retired Gen. James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary, even though his recent tenure in the active-duty military means he'll need a special waiver that requires 60 votes in the Senate.

But some of Trump's picks, Democrats say, represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they've been tapped to lead, and so the nominees have no business in those jobs.

There's Trump's reported pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil, who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There's Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has made a name for himself by suing the agency. There's Andy Puzder, Trump's choice for the Labor Department, a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots.

There's Betsy DeVos, a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education, whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department. And there's attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, an anti-immigration hard-liner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments.


Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks poring over the financial statements, personal histories and public utterances of Trump's most polarizing Cabinet selections, hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird  Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees who were forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process.

And Democrats have reason to believe Trump's nominees provide an especially rich vein for digging, because according to reports, few have been subjected to a traditionally thorough vetting process by his transition team. Many are wealthy business executives with sprawling financial entanglements and no political experience or the scrutiny that comes with it.

""What's unusual about Trump's Cabinet picks is that so few of them come from politics, which means that they're going to have a harder time than usual going through the traditional vet and public evaluation,"" said Simon Rosenberg, president of the Democratic think tank NDN. ""Some of them are going to crash. Some of them aren't going to make it because of things that are going to come up in their background.""

Democrats will have to pick their battles, and priorities will likely be decided based not only by how threatening they find Trump's nominees, but how vulnerable the nominees are after some digging.

Related: Donald Trump Builds Cabinet with Old Friends and Some Rivals

""Much of it depends on what's uncovered in the vetting process,"" said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""As Senator Daschle found out, one little thing can trip you up.""

Daschle was nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services in 2009 but removed his name after controversy over his taxes emerged.

Old domestic abuse allegations related to a messy divorce have already surfaced with Puzder. But complicated financial issues are more likely to trip up Trump's nominees than personal indiscretions, especially given the number of super-wealthy candidates Trump has chosen.

""The Senate Finance Committee has developed a reputation as somewhat of a killing field for nominees in recent years,"" Manley said. ""They've developed the experience to really pick apart the financials.""

And Trump's team may be flying blind to some extent. His transition team has reportedly forgone the rigorous vetting process traditionally performed on potential nominees before they are announced publicly, leaving his picks potentially vulnerable to surprises.

Selecting Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-kansas, as CIA director was ""pretty simple,"" said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, who is working on Trump's transition team.

""They asked me who would be the person for the agency, and I said without a doubt that Pompeo would be a great pick,"" Nunes told Politico.

Dan Kanninen, a former Obama White House official who helped choose candidates for jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, said it takes weeks or months for even the best transition teams to properly vet candidates.

""With Trump, none of that, as far as we can tell, happened before the election. And now, if it is happening at all, it's happening in a matter of days based on the gut on the president-elect,"" he said. ""It would not surprise me at all, given how little we know  and frankly how little the Trump team knows  if something came up with of a magnitude that might kill some of their nominations.""

Even under the best of circumstances, things get missed. Clinton rescinded Baird's nomination to be attorney general because it was discovered that she had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny.

The Senate confirmation process can be brutal even for squeaky clean candidates who have spent their whole careers in government. A ""Survivor's Guide for Presidential Nominees"" prepared by the National Academy of Public Administration, a congressionally chartered non-profit, stretches over 71 pages and warns, ""If you are not nervous going into your confirmation hearing, you should be.""

 Nov. 24: Trump Scrutinized Over Cabinet Picks, Intelligence Briefings 2:38
It may be especially bumpy for Trump's nominees from the private sector, who are not accustomed to government processes and who have not already gone through the kind of public and legal scrutiny politicians and government officials are used to.

Three years ago, facing Republican obstruction, Senate Democrats decided to kill the filibuster for executive branch appointments, which means they now cannot force Republicans to find the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. Republicans need only 51 votes in the Senate to confirm Trump's Cabinet picks.

Democrats would need three Republicans to join them to shoot down any of Trump's nominees, and so far none have expressed interest in taking up the cause.

Some Democrats, unsurprisingly, are having buyer's remorse about the filibuster change, including Reid's successor as Democratic Leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York.

""I wanted 60 for Supreme Court and Cabinet, but I didn't prevail,"" Schumer told The Washington Post.

Still, he vowed opposition to some nominees, however possible. ""If it's somebody who is out of the mainstream,"" Schumer said, ""we'll fight tooth and nail and use every tool we have.""

The Senate has traditionally deferred to new presidents' wishes in filling out their Cabinets, approving many nominees without bothering to even take formal votes.

Recent incoming presidents have had to withdraw only one or two Cabinet picks, if any at all, and the Senate has voted to outright reject just three nominees in the past 100 years, according to the Senate historian.

But Democrats are in no mood to be deferential to Trump after Republicans, in their view, broke with tradition by obstructing Obama Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland for nine months and fought the confirmation of his second attorney general, Loretta Lynch.

And they say Trump has chosen blatantly provocative or unqualified nominees, instead of trying to find common ground in a divided country.

""Donald Trump is kind of giving a big middle finger to that entire department by nominating someone who was found to have 50 percent of his restaurants in noncompliance with labor laws,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, told MSNBC on Friday of Trump's decision to name Puzder to head the department responsible for protecting workers. ",2

President Obama's final weeks in office
The split by party is predictably stark: 86% of Democrats say Obama will be judged to have been a good or great president; 83% of Republicans say he will be seen as a fair or failed one.

""There was a lot of hope but a lot of under-delivery with him,"" says David Ockrim, 30, who operates a Yankee Doodle Dandy food truck in New York City.

""A total failure,"" scoffs Stephen Spence, 69, of Mesa, Ariz. ""On the economy, on immigration, on helping people from other countries that are fighting ISIS.""

""I think history would judge him well, but it's probably going to take a while,"" says Queen Jones, 73, a retired teacher's assistant from Mount Pleasant, N.C. ""I think he'll be judged well because of what he inherited when he came in and where the economy is right now.""

The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Wednesday through Sunday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Trump is within his rights to use executive power, Obama says
Overall, Obama is leaving office with healthy ratings. By 55%-40%, Americans have a favorable opinion of him. That's much better than Trump's ratings, which remain underwater by 5 points  41% favorable, 46% unfavorable  although the president-elect's standing has been improving. Just before Election Day, in late October, Trump was at 31% favorable, 61% unfavorable in the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll.

Fifty-four percent now approve of the job Obama is doing as president.

When it comes to ranking his greatest achievements as president, close to one in four cite the Affordable Care Act. Nearly as many, 22%, name the economy's recovery after the Great Recession.

""If you look at the long-term history of the country, George W. Bush left him, frankly, with a pile of"" trouble, says Kathleen Hoynes, 56, of Upper Gwynedd, north of Philadelphia, using an expletive and crediting Obama with rescuing the economy. That said, she went on, ""I did not agree with a lot of what he did in not getting out of war and on race relations. He didn't do enough.""

Indeed, dealing with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ranks second on the list of Obama's failures, and handling race relations is third. It was cited by 15% of whites and 13% of blacks. As the nation's only African-American president, expectations were high that his election represented a breakthrough in race relations.

The Affordable Care Act was cited by 27% on the list of his biggest failures, nearly twice as many as any other issue.",2
"114","163.txt","Lawyer: 'Appalled' by FBI warrant that shook Clinton","WASHINGTON  The FBI warrant that shook Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign in its final two weeks has been unsealed, and the lawyer who requested it says it offers ""nothing at all"" to merit the agency's actions leading up to the Nov. 8 election.

The warrant was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Los Angeles lawyer Randy Schoenberg, who wants to determine what probable cause the agency provided to suspect material on disgraced congressman Anthony Weiners computer might be incriminating to Clinton. Weiner is the estranged husband of Clintons top aide, Huma Abedin. Under the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure can only be granted when proof of probable cause of criminal findings has been documented.

The letter confirms news reports in late October that the FBI had detected non-content header information suggesting correspondence with accounts involved in its already-completed investigation of Clinton's private email server. The FBI request concludes there is probable cause to believe that the laptop contained evidence, contraband, fruits and/or items illegally possessed, without providing specifics.

""I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between"" Clinton and Abedin, Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY. It remains unknown ""why they thought they might find evidence of a crime, why they felt it necessary to inform Congress, and why they even sought this search warrant,"" he said. ""I am appalled."" The FBI's Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

Clinton campaign officials echoed Schoenberg's complaints Tuesday. Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that the ""unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.""

New emails under review in Clinton case emerged from Weiner probe
FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton's email
The FBI concluded in July that there was no clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws and that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Then, two weeks before the election, Comey sent a three-paragraph letter to Congress that said in the course of an unrelated investigation investigators found emails that appear to be pertinent to Clintons private email server. Comey also wrote that he could not assess whether the material was significant.

The letter was so vague that Clintons opponents seized on it to shift the narrative from a damaging drumbeat of news stories about Donald Trump, including his past treatment of women. Trump called it bigger than Watergate and predicted that the FBI would ""right the ship"" after previously deciding against criminal charges.

Comeys investigation was the primary cudgel for Trump and his supporters, who claimed  falsely  that Clinton was guilty of criminal activity. His large rallies regularly chanted Lock her up! and Clintons motorcade was greeted in city after city with angry crowds waving signs.

Abedins lawyers have also been requesting permission to review the warrant, which they say their client never saw and hadnt or even been alerted to, preventing them from responding publicly in the final days of the campaign. Two days before the election, Comey confirmed there was no new information.

At the same time, Comey was in possession of evidence showing Russia was hacking into the Democratic Party apparatus, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., accused him of holding back explosive information about Russian interference. The retiring senator said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits activity directed towards the success or failure of a candidate.

On Monday, former president Bill Clinton said his wife fought through everything, and she prevailed against it all. But she couldnt endure the combination of the FBIs interference and Russian meddling. At the end, we had the Russians and the FBI deal. But she couldnt prevail against that, Clinton told reporters in Albany.

Republicans have mocked the Clintons contention and said its an excuse for some of the strategic mistakes the campaign made.

Yet the election was decided by the smallest of margins in a handful of Rust Belt states. Nate Silver, a leading elections statistician and editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, says Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race"" and that she would almost certainly be president-elect if the election had been held the day before the letter. He cited late-deciding voters breaking strongly against her enough to cost her Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Schoenberg said more information needs to be made public before the matter is put to rest. ""The FBI agents name has not been disclosed, but I think that it may be appropriate to find out his/her name and determine what the motivations were, since it must have been obvious to the FBI that there was no real probable cause to believe they would find evidence of a crime,"" he said in a follow-up email.  ""It was very wrong for Director Comey to give that impression.""

""They focused on wrong states,"" Trump said in a brief tweet burst.

In an interview with a weekly newspaper in New York state, Clinton said that Trump ""doesn't know much,"" but ""one thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him."" Clinton also said that Trump called him after the election, another source of dispute between the two men.

Tweeted Trump: ""Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations).""

The president-elect said Clinton is the one who ""doesn't know much,"" including ""how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more).""

While losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by more than 2.8 million, Trump triumphed in the Electoral College by winning more states. They included industrial states that had gone Democratic in recent presidential elections: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

Electors in those and other states ratified Trump's victory in Monday meetings of the Electoral College.

Despite the efforts of anti-Trump organizations, only two electors defected from the Republican candidate; five Democratic electors refused to vote for Clinton.

""With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead,"" the president-elect said after the Electoral College vote. ""I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans. Together, we will make America great again.

After a truck attack on a holiday market in Berlin, Trump said ""innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday ... These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.""

Trump also spoke out after Russia's ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was ""assassinated by a radical Islamic terrorist.""

He added: ""The murder of an ambassador is a violation of all rules of civilized order and must be universally condemned.",2
"116","165.txt","Trumps vow to undo Obama rules? Not so fast","WASHINGTON  President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a vow to repeal what he claims are job-killing federal regulations, including rules limiting power plant emissions, protecting rivers and streams, and preventing banks from reckless lending.

Easier said than done.

The same deliberate process used to enact the Clean Power Plant rule, the waters of the U.S. Clean Water Rule, or regulations under the Dodd-Frank law designed to clamp down on Wall Street usually requires the same long slog to undo them, making quick repeal unattainable.

In general, rule changes originate from the agencies who must offer a legal, scientific or other legitimate reason in defense of the proposed change, and solicit public comments first before a new rule or its repeal can take effect. In most cases, the final rule may not become effective until at least 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register.

The process is laborious, but that shouldnt stop every agency head from setting it in motion, Andy Koenig, vice president of policy at the Koch-affiliated Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a recent column on the groups website. The very fact that it is so time-consuming makes it essential for agencies to start the process immediately.

Republicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulations
Small businesses can expect policy changes under Trump
But a Republican president and a compliant Congress controlled by Republicans can still do quite a bit in short order to block a host of proposed regulations or reverse rules that were recently implemented. Overall, critics say regulations pose a $4 trillion drag  on to the U.S. economy every year, according to some estimates, though agencies also design rules to maximize economic benefits.

Stakeholders have been weighing in about the rules they'd like to see tossed.

Among them is the House Freedom Caucus, the hard right faction of House lawmakers who have clashed with congressional leaders in recent years. The group Wednesday asked the incoming Trump administration to jettison 227 rules its members view as burdensome, costly or unworkable, including ones setting nutrition standards for school lunches, requiring certain animal and plant inspections, and development of alternative fuels.

Despite some steep hurdles, heres what Trump and Congress can do:

Incoming presidents can prevent regulations that have yet to be finalized from ever taking effect.

Its standard practice for a new administration to freeze any regulations that are in the pipeline until the incoming regime can review them, said Jerry Ellig, senior research fellow at George Mason Universitys Mercatus Center.

President Obama did just than when he came into office in 2009, as did his predecessors.

If its something that the current administration has finished and sent to the Federal Register but it isnt published before Inauguration Day, then its easy for a new administration to pull those rules back, he said.

Many could still go forward after the review is complete and the Trump administration supports them.

Congress also has a limited window where it can undo rules with a simple majority vote that cannot be filibustered. 

Such resolutions of disapproval must be passed and signed within 60 legislative days from their publication in the federal register and their insertion into the Congressional Record.

Under the Congressional Review Act, agencies must report on their rulemaking activities to Congress and provide lawmakers a legislative roadmap to overturn those rules if they oppose them, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The Mercatus Center lists 172 Obama administration rules adopted since June 9 that could be subject to the review act. They include rules on implementing school wellness policies, regulating municipal solid waste landfills and food labeling guidelines.

But the incoming Congress will have to be picky because the law requires that rule reversals can only be done one at a time. With all the other priorities facing them such as working on a budget and considering Trumps nominees, theres may not be much floor time for wholesale regulatory rollback, Ellig said.

That hurdle helps explain why the Congressional Review Act has been used only once since it became law 20 years ago. In 2001, Congress and the George W. Bush administration overturned a Clinton administration rule setting an ergonomics standard for the workplace.

Agencies can decide not to enforce certain regulations because theyre focused on other priorities. Or the Trump administration could choose to stop defending rules if they are the subject of a court challenge.

That passive approach is a pretty easy way to undermine laws that are already around and public protections that already exist, said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizens Congress Watch, a government watchdog group.

Deciding not to defend the regulation in court wouldnt guarantee the rules demise.

Affected third parties would likely still be arguing for its enforcement and judges could still rule on the legality of the provision. But it could leave open questions that we would obviously rather have answered about our regulatory state, Gilbert said.

Lawmakers could pass a law undoing the rule.

The cleanest  and in many ways steepest  path to eliminating a rule is to have Congress approve legislation doing just that.

Thats what it will probably take to gut some of the Obama administrations most high-profile regulations, such as ones associated with clean water, clean power, overtime protections, the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform.

Within that category, there are several approaches: using spending bills to insert language known as riders preventing an agency from allocating funds to enforce a regulation, using a process known as reconciliation to fast-track bills to undo rules, and passing bills through the regular legislative process.

That last option is least desirable for regulatory reformers because it could take years, and it gives Democrats the chance to stop a rule rollback through filibuster.

None of this includes the executive orders that President Trump could undo with a stroke of his pen, namely President Obama's deportation protections for millions of undocumented immigrants who arrived here as young children.

Trump has already unveiled his plan to tackle regulation reform: Ask all department heads to submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs, and which does not improve public safety, and eliminate them.

Gilbert, with Public Citizen, said its hard to predict how many of the Obama-era rules will survive.

Our success in (preserving) any of them is going to depend on our ability to make it very clear to the American public ... what it means to take away these things that are so populist, so important, she said. Nobody wants to lose pay raises theyve already achieved or protections of their health and their air.",2
"117","166.txt","What the intelligence briefing says about Obama's presidency  and Trump's","WASHINGTON  The very first President's Intelligence Checklist  the predecessor to what's now known as the President's Daily Briefing  was delivered to President John F. Kennedy on a June Saturday in 1961. Typewritten on eight pages of 8.5-by-8-inch paper and stamped ""For the President Only  Top Secret,"" it contained 14 two-sentence briefs culled from diplomatic, military, intelligence and press sources, six shorter notes, and maps of Laos and the Congo.

Today, President Obama receives the document on an iPad. The articles are somewhat longer and sometimes have dissenting opinions. The maps can be interactive, and the briefings can include video.

The differences aren't just technological. After serving 10 presidents  and now preparing to brief the 11th, President-elect Donald Trump  the President's Daily Briefing has had to adjust to the reading habits and decision-making styles of each commander in chief.

And the ways in which it's produced, read and discussed provide a rare insight into how presidents approach national security issues.

""Its the only standing meeting he has every day. Even if we dont have the meeting, he gets the document,"" said Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes. ""Everyday there's the possibility that he'll see something that will cause him to move the entire U.S. government in a new direction. There's nothing else like that.""

For Obama, the PDB process paints a portrait of a methodical president who's often disdainful of raw, unfiltered intelligence in favor of more analytical perspective. He encourages dissenting opinions. He's interested in ""open source"" intelligence  including press accounts and, increasingly, social media  in addition to old-fashioned spycraft and intercepted communications.

President-elect Trump has yet to make a formal mark on intelligence. He's still getting a daily intelligence briefing designed for, and catered to, Obama. He's reading it largely as a courtesy by the incumbent president, part of a bipartisan tradition dating back to President Harry Truman.

But Trump has already suggested a different style of receiving intelligence. For the first month, he received in-person intelligence briefings only once a week, although his transition team now says it's three times a week.

But Trump himself has suggested a more ad hoc system of being updated only when major developments warrant.

""I get it when I need it,"" Trump told Fox News Sunday.

""I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,"" he said. ""I don't need that. But I do say, 'If something should change, let us know.' ""

In skipping daily briefings, Trump shows ambivalence toward intel agencies
Aides: Trump gets frequent classified briefings
Obama has said much the same about his daily briefing  albeit much later in his presidency.

""Over the years, you accumulate knowledge,"" Obama said in a YouTube interview earlier this year. ""Now, I've got enough of a baseline of knowledge. I've seen problems come up before, I've seen patterns that have emerged. I might not have to go into the briefing book as deeply as I did. ... I'm skimming. I'm looking at, are there significant differences?""

The frequency, the duration, the format, the depth, the subject matter  even the distribution list  are all up to the president.

In a book published earlier this year, former CIA officer David Priess argued that the PDB has had to adapt to each president who has receives it  and will continue to evolve to meet the president's personality, learning style and priorities.

""If a new president comes in and he wants the PDB presented through interpretive dance, he or she will get that,"" said Priess, author of The President's Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings. ""There will be a whole lot of intelligence officers taking dancing lessons.""

The President's Daily Briefing is what its name implies, Priess said.

""It is brief. Everything is not going to make it in. Its daily. If its not breaking, or not current, it doesnt get in,"" he said. ""But the most important word is 'president.' Is this deserving of his attention?""

That's a question that the intelligence community is constantly trying to reassess. And the transition period is a critical time for the incoming president to get up to speed on intelligence issues  and for the intelligence community to get to know the president-elect.

Current and former national security officials say frequent, in-person briefings with the president  and the president-elect  are an essential part of making sure the commander in chief is well-informed.

""There is a certain amount of trial and error to really settle in to what the new team wants,"" former CIA director Michael Hayden said. In his book, Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror, he describes what the intelligence community crudely refers to as the ""aw, s---"" moment.

Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four-star general,

It's attempt by intelligence officials to challenge the worldview of the president-elect's political advisers with a dose of reality. Hayden calls it ""phenomenon of the unpleasant fact.""

""That's when the intelligence guys give the president information and analysis that cuts across the policy or politics grain of the administration. You're telling them something they dont want to hear and dont want to believe,"" he said.

And it's important to do that in an in-person briefing, as opposed to the written product. ""You have to shake the preferred narrative of the policymaker,"" Hayden said. ""And you need the ability to do that face to face, and to do it with your tone, and your words and your body language to communicate, as opposed to just throwing it over the transom.""

When Obama first took office, the intelligence community grumbled that Obama  or at least his national security staff  wanted the reports so brief that they called them ""PDB haiku.""

Hayden's early briefings of Obama (he was replaced three weeks into Obama's presidency) were ""far less tactical"" than the briefings President George W. Bush was receiving.

But Michael Leiter, who directed the National Counterterrorism Center under both Bush and Obama, said he saw Obama grow in his use of intelligence from those early months.

""His inclination from the start was less about the tactics and more about the strategy, and more about how the U.S. was perceived in the world and interacted in the world,"" he said.

""But there certainly was an evolution. To me, that was most crystallized, around the time of underwear bomber,"" he said, referring to the Christmas Day 2009 plot to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner. ""That so changed the president's perception of how detail oriented he had to be on these things.""

From then on, he said, any terrorism threat the president was briefed about also had to include an operational briefing about what was being done to address it.

Still, it's a difficult balancing act for the president and his briefing team. Rhodes said the president needs to be disciplined enough not to be distracted by the uncorroborated bits of information  or to attribute more credibility to information only because it's classified. ""Sometimes you are so focused on what is secret that you're not looking at what's right in front of your eyes,"" Rhodes said in an interview with USA TODAY before the election.

""Its worrisome to get into raw intelligence,"" he said. ""Because you may have some intercept that you think is great, but it could be some official in some country, it could be just their view, or what they hope happens. Or, sometimes they know that the (National Security Agency) is listening, and they want us to intercept that raw intelligence. That's where the job of ODNI is very hard.""

ODNI is the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, an office created by Congress in 2004 in a series of post-9/11 intelligence reforms. While the briefing is assembled by ODNI with input from the entire intelligence community, the CIA  by virtue of its historic role and experience in analysis  still has an outsized role in the process.

Obama has said he's conscientious about hearing from a broad array of experts. ""I've learned to be pretty good at listening carefully to people who know a lot more than I do about a topic,"" Obama said in the YouTube interview. ""And taking sure that any dissenting voices are in the same room at the same time.""

But while Obama says he listens to all voices, not all of those voices feel that they're being heard.

A 2014 report from the Intelligence Community Inspector General interviewed intelligence analysts across the government and found that ""broader community participation in the President's Daily Brief (PDB) remains a challenge.""

Rhodes said the president has increasingly asked for lower-level analysts who are experts in a political topic to brief him personally  a practice that has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter's presidency. ""Let's get the analysts who are living through these issues every day,"" Rhodes said. ""He likes that, so he's tried to do that more.""

The daily book often contains dissenting views, which Leiter said were ""often the most illuminating thing in a PDB article.""

And under Obama, non-urgent raw intelligence often gets shopped around the intelligence community for corroboration and analysis before making it to the president. And highly sensitive information gleaned from top-secret sources and methods is balanced with open-source intelligence  the kind of information that's available to anyone reading a newspaper.

'Rebalancing' the PDB

Presidents, of course, also send signals back to the intelligence community about their policy priorities  and that gets reflected in their briefings.

Richard Nixon's had a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and China. Ronald Reagan's was almost singularly obsessed with the Soviet Union. And for the last two presidents, the Middle East has dominated the PDB  to the extent that the White House has occasionally had to remind intelligence agencies that Obama wants a wider aperture.

""You could write the PDB every day and never talk about anything except the Middle East and Russia,"" Rhodes said. ""To the point where weve had to say, 'Hey, guys, we're rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific. Make sure that's represented in the PDB.' You almost have to reach out for that stuff, because it doesn't always naturally come up.""

Obama's PDB also increasingly includes information on economic, environmental and public health crises that could have an impact on national security. And they're not necessarily confined to foreign affairs. Last summer, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that Obama had been briefed on the spread of the Zika virus in Florida as part of his daily intelligence briefing.

World's most exclusive newspaper

The President's Daily Briefing, also known as ""the book,"" is among the most secret documents the government keeps. For a time, even its very existence was thought to be classified.

It's just one of dozens of products regularly produced by the intelligence community. But because it gets the attention of the commander in chief, it has a sense of urgency and importance  and even mystique  that other top secret documents don't have.

""Today it is such a vital part of how the White House operates that one can hardly imagine the modern presidency without it,"" said CIA Director John Brennan as the agency declassified 2,500 briefings to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson last year. ""The PDB is the most abundantly staffed, most deeply sourced daily information service in the world.""

It's been referred to as the world's most exclusive daily newspaper, written exclusively for the president of the United States.

But presidents can and do share the PDB with a small circle of advisers.

Kennedy never shared his with his vice president. Nixon deeply distrusted the CIA and often ignored the briefing, instead delegating it to national security adviser Henry Kissinger.

The younger Bush restricted the distribution to just six or seven people. In the Obama administration, the distribution list is thought to be as many as two dozen, including the secretary of State. In her book Hard Choices, Clinton called the hand-delivered report the ""first order of business"" after getting to the office each morning. Her schedules, released under the Freedom of Information Act, often allotted the first five minutes of every morning to reading the PDB.

The president could even share the briefing with members of his family. Trump and his family have denied reports that he's sought security clearances for his children and for son-in-law Jared Kushner, but the president is the ultimate authority on how classified information can be shared and with whom.

Trump has also raised eyebrows by appearing to question the CIA's integrity in the wake of reports that the spy agency had concluded that Russia deliberately interfered in the election to get Trump elected. ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" the Trump transition said in a statement to reporters last week.

That prompted the White House to defend the intelligence officers  and suggest that Trump would do well to listen to them.

""President Obamas experience over the last eight years has been that the men and women of the intelligence community in the United States are patriots,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. ""President Obama is certainly not the first president to have enjoyed the benefits of the experts in our intelligence community, and I'm confident the president-elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it.""",2
"118","167.txt","Trump wins Electoral College vote as insurgency fizzles","WASHINGTON  Donald Trump will  officially  become president next month.

Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed from 538 electors casting their ballots, in a day of normally ceremonial voting that drew attention amid intense social media pressure and protests in state capitols.

Despite a last-minute push by outside progressive and Libertarian groups, there was no rebellion. In fact, most of the ""faithless"" electors appeared to be Hillary Clinton defectors in Washington state, with three voting for former secretary of State Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American an environmental activist. Two Texas GOP electors went rogue and didn't vote for Trump.

The meetings, which occur more than a month after the Nov. 8 election, are typically a formality. This year, Trump critics mounted a vocal campaign appealing to the Republican electors pledged to vote for him. The official results of the vote will be announced before Congress on Jan. 6, although the results from each state were released throughout the day Monday.

Confirmation by the FBI and CIA that the Russian government hacked Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee seeking to help Trump win the election have amplified their calls.

Frankly, at this point, I'm wondering if Putin helped Trump win the Republican primary,"" Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who's been an outspoken critic, said before the voting began. In Rhode Island, electors passed a motion calling for an independent, bipartisan investigation into Russian intervention in the election as Congress debates whether the matter should be reviewed by Republican-led committees or as an independent probe.

Thousands of protesters gathered outside state capitals throughout the country. Yet in the end, the rebellion fell far short of the dozens of potential faithless electors that some Trump opponents said could materialize.


Opponents would have needed 37 GOP electors to switch their votes. The one alternative to Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, had told electors not to vote for him. Even if there were a mass defection, the matter would have kicked to the Republican-led House of Representatives, which was unlikely to override their own partys president. Further, the Republican National Committee conducted a parallel whip effort to make sure electors stick to the plan to vote for Trump.

Clinton won more than 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide. But Trump won a majority of the 538 electoral votes  the state-by-state system created by the nation's founders based on the size of a states congressional delegation.

A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote
Its the second time in recent history, including Democrat Al Gores loss in 2000 to George W. Bush, that the person winning the popular vote lost the election. Before that, it hadnt been since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland, that a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote.

The trend is causing Democrats to question the system by which the nation chooses its leaders, according to a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll. It finds 50% of registered voters believe the Electoral College should choose the president. Yet more than four in 10  42%  say the Constitution should be amended so the popular vote prevails in choosing the commander in chief. Liberals are most likely to want a change while conservatives want to keep the current system.

Trump assumes the mantle with an electorate deeply skeptical of his presidency, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. While the percentage of voters who view him positively has increased to 41%, thats 7 points less than those who view him unfavorably. While 45% said they were optimistic and satisfied about Trump as president, its 21 points below Obamas number in January 2009 and 14 points below George W. Bushs number at the same time in 2000.",2
"119","168.txt","Trump is within his rights to use executive power, Obama says","WASHINGTON  President Obama says he has no regrets about his go-it-alone use of executive power  even if President-elect Donald Trump can now use those same powers to roll back his policies.

""I think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so,"" Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio broadcast Monday. ""If he wants to reverse some of those rules, that's part of the democratic process.""

In his traditional end-of-year public radio interview, Obama offered a wide-ranging defense of his use of presidential power as he prepares to turn the levers of that power over to man he once described as unfit for the presidency.

Obama argued that his use of executive action wasn't much different from his predecessors. What changed, he said, is that Congress became less willing to pass legislation.

""Congress has become so dysfunctional that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they're not constantly refreshed and tweaked,"" he said. ""And the bottom line is, if you want to right-size executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation.""

The same thing has happened on foreign policy, he said. The Obama administration has been relying a post-9/11 congressional war authorization intended for al-Qaeda in order to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

""The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in,"" he said. ""The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate.""

But Obama also said he's installed ""guardrails"" on the president's war powers, setting up systems of internal accountability on issues like drone strikes and electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency.

""You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven't gone far enough on that. I would argue that we've gotten it about right, although I'm the first one to admit that we didn't get it all right on day one,"" he said.",2

Whether it is his distinguished military service or highly impressive track record in the world of business, Vinnie has proved throughout his life that he knows how to be a leader and deliver major results in the face of any challenge,"" Trump said in a statement.

Trump has pledged to increase the size of the nation's armed forces.

Viola, founder and chairman of Virtu Financial and owner of pro hockey's Florida Panthers, said in a statement that, if confirmed by the Senate, ""I will work tirelessly to provide our President with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy.""

His primary focus, Viola said, ""will be ensuring that Americas soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict.""

Trump made the announcement the same day that members of the Electoral College cast their votes for president in state capitals across the country. While anti-Trump groups are urging electors to vote for someone else, electors are expected to ratify the New York businessman's victory in last month's election.

The president-elect is operating from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he plans to stay through at least Christmas Day.

As secretary of the Army, Viola would work with retired general James Mattis, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of Defense.

The president-elect took to his Twitter feed to respond Tuesday morning.

Clinton made the initial remarks last week to a group of people he ran into at a small bookstore in Westchester County, NY, including an editor at the Bedford-Pound Ridge Record Review, who published Clinton's comments.

""James Comey cost her the election,"" Clinton reportedly said, referring to Comey sending a letter to lawmakers just two weeks before the election about the finding of new emails the FBI said could be pertinent to an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server during her time as secretary of state. Clinton added, ""We were seven (percentage) points up"" in the polls and slated to win before Comey's announcement.

Two days before the election, Comey told members of Congress that the FBI found nothing new in the e-mails but Clinton maintained the damage had already been done.

In the reports of Clinton's stop at the bookstore, Clinton was characterized has having had taken a call from Trump after the election and described it as ""cordial."" On Tuesday afternoon, Clinton sought to clear up who initiated the phone call through his own Twitter feed:

Clinton was also asked at the book store if he thought Trump was a smart man. ""He doesn't know much. One thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him,"" Clinton reportedly responded. He had previously said he believed Russia was also to blame for releasing internal Democratic emails and documents that hurt his wife's election's prospects before Election Day.

""I've watched her battle through that bogus email deal and be vindicated at the end,"" Clinton said earlier this week. ""She fought through everything, and she prevailed against it all. But, you know, with the end we had the Russians and the FBI deal, which she couldn't prevail against that.""",2
"122","171.txt","Poll: Majority of Americans Pessimistic or Uncertain About Trump Presidency","As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in as the country's commander-in-chief next month, a majority of Americans say they are either uncertain or pessimistic about his presidency, even as the country is sounding a more optimistic tone about the future of the economy and Trump's ability to bring positive change to Washington D.C.

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds 54 percent of adults saying that they are either uncertain (25 percent) or pessimistic and worried (29 percent) about how Trump will perform during his presidency, compared with 45 percent with either an optimistic and confident view (22 percent) or a satisfied and hopeful view (23 percent).

That's a significantly worse outlook than Americans expressed after the elections of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. A combined 66 percent were either optimistic or hopeful about Obama in January 2009, according to the same poll, while 59 percent were optimistic or hopeful about George W. Bush in January 2001.


The data show the extent to which the nation remains unusually divided even though Election Day is in the rearview mirror, said Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, which conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm Public Opinion Strategies.

""Usually elections settle arguments and the nation comes together, at least in the short term,"" Yang said. ""Today, hard feelings persist on both sides of the partisan divide. It's as if the 2016 campaign has never ended.""

Those partisan differences are particularly stark when it comes to public approval ratings of the way Trump is handling his transition. Half of the country overall gives Trump high marks so far, compared to 41 percent who give him a thumbs down. But among Hillary Clinton's voters, only 12 percent approve of how he's handling the transition, compared to 92 percent of Trump voters.

Back in 2008, 50 percent of John McCain's voters approved of Barack Obama's handling of his presidential transition, and in 1992, 63 percent of George H.W. Bush's voters backed Bill Clinton's early moves as president-elect.


The partisan divide extends to views about the men and women Trump has selected to lead his administration. Seventy-eight percent of Democrats say they are disappointed with the administration appointments Trump has made so far, while 80 percent of Republicans say they are generally pleased with Trump's picks.

While Trump's overall favorability has ticked up modestly since before the election, he remains underwater, with more Americans giving him a poor rating (46 percent) than a positive one (40 percent.)

That marks the first time that an incoming president has been viewed more negatively than positively in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.

Some bright spots -- but ones mostly driven by enthusiasm from Trump's supporters

While the public is largely apprehensive about the president-elect, Americans do say that they are more optimistic that the U.S. economy will improve in the next year. Forty-two percent say they believe the economy will get better - the highest share since autumn of 2012 -- while only 19 percent say the economy will get worse in the next year.

Trump has also generated relatively positive feelings about his ability to change the federal government for the better. A majority of Americans say Trump will shake up the way government operates - and, among that group, they believe that he'll bring the right kind of change by a two-to-one margin (41 percent to 20 percent).

Additionally, a majority - fifty-six percent - say they are optimistic that Trump will keep U.S. jobs from going overseas.


Still, the confidence about Trump's presidency is mostly fueled by enthusiasm among his base voters rather than by more hopeful expectations among those who didn't choose him on their ballot in November.

A whopping 92 percent of Trump voters are optimistic about his ability to bring change to Washington, while just 20 percent of Clinton voters say the same. The same share of Trump voters - 92 percent - say they are hopeful that Trump will look out for those who are struggling in today's economy, while only nine percent of Clinton voters agree.


Those who say that the economy will get better in the next year rather than worse include key Trump constituency groups like whites (49 percent better compared to 15 percent worse), Republicans (68 percent better to six percent worse), and men (46 percent better to 15 percent worse.) Among Democrats, 33 percent believe the economy will get worse compared to 19 percent who believe it will improve, and just 22 percent of African Americans think the economy will improve compared to a third who say it will deteriorate.

The public also still harbors concerns about Trump's temperament. Just 36 percent of Americans say they are optimistic that Trump has the right temperament to be president, while 44 percent say they are worried about the issue.

The Republican Party gets a boost - but will it last?

In the wake of the 2016 election, the Republican Party now has a higher net favorability rating (35 percent positive, 38 percent negative) than the Democratic Party (34 percent positive, 42 percent negative). That's the first time since after the 2010 midterms that Republicans have scored better on the favorability measure than their Democratic counterparts.

But it's not clear that Americans' warmer feelings toward the GOP will endure. After its previous high watermark six years ago, the party's positive ratings quickly fell back to earth, with Democrats regaining the advantage the following month.",2

""So we're going to be there for the next president and do whatever we have to do to make sure that he is successful, because if he succeeds, we all succeed,"" Obama told Winfrey during her final one-on-one White House interview, which aired Monday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.

In the one-hour program, Obama reflected on her eight years as first lady, discussing topics including her surprise at being called an ""angry black woman"" during her husband's 2007 presidential campaign and Trump's comments about women.

""For all the people out there, they have to understand that, as I've said time and time again, words matter,"" she said. ""And they matter most to our kids, our young people.

""Sixteen years, I wouldn't do that to my kids because what people don't understand is that you run, their lives stop, at any age,"" she said. ""The next family that comes in here, every person in that family, every child, every grandchild, their lives will be turned upside down in a way that no American really understands.""

Winfrey also asked about Trump's post-election visit to the White House.

""It was very pleasant,"" she said. ""It was a wonderful visit because this is a really great job.""

Obama said she and Melania Trump talked about the kids and said she told the incoming first lady that her ""door is open"" for any questions.

""My offer to Melania was you really don't know what you don't know until you're here, so the door is open as I've told her,"" Obama said, adding that she's modeling what the Bushes had done for her.

Obama also took time to reflect on her accomplishments, saying she thinks she moved the needle on childhood obesity and changed the conversation on how Americans look at the military.

President Barack Obama also made an appearance during the interview, discussing what surprised him about how his wife filled the role of first lady.

""We all knew she was brilliant and cute and strong and a great mom,"" the president said. ""But I think the way in which she blended purpose and policy with fun, so that she was able to reach beyond Washington on her healthcare initiatives, on her military family work, was masterful.""

""There's nowhere I can go in the world and just sit at a table and have a cup of coffee and watch the world,"" she said.

Toward the end, Winfrey returned to a question she had put to Michelle Obama eight years earlier, when she asked about Obama's prayers for her family.

Obama's response at the time, Winfrey said, was that ""we remain whole.""

""So now, I ask you, what is your prayer for our country?"" Winfrey continued.

The president-elect easily racked up the 270 electoral votes needed to send him to the White House. Interest in the normally mundane voting process spiked this year as opposition to Trump continues to fester, fueled by Clinton's success in capturing over 2.6 million more votes than her Republican opponent.

""Today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I thank the American people for their overwhelming vote to elect me as their next President of the United States.""

He added, ""this election represents a movement that millions of hard working men and women all across the country stood behind and made possible. With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead. I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans.""

Anti-Trump protesters descended on state capitols throughout the U.S. in a last-ditch effort to persuade so-called ""faithless electors"" in states Trump won to change their vote. Many of the Republicans casting ballots said they were inundated with calls and emails urging them to dump Trump.

And some electors did break with how their state voted, albeit in unexpected ways. In Washington, a state Clinton won by 16 points, the former secretary of state received just eight of the state's 12 electoral votes. Colin Powell received three votes and Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle received one as part of an effort to promote a candidate other than Trump.

"125","174.txt","Key Union Backs Tom Perez for DNC Chair, Breaking With AFL-CIO","The International Association of Firefighters, the main union representing American firefighters, has placed itself on a collision course with the AFL-CIO in the race for the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, deciding to back Labor Secretary Tom Perez over Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison.

The Democratic leadership contest has taken on unusual significance in the wake of Hillary Clinton's devastating loss last month, dividing the labor movement between two Democrats whom it has long seen as allies.

The AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 unions that includes the IAFF, endorsed Ellison just before Perez entered the race last week, despite protests from IAFF President Harold Schaitberger and others.

In a statement, Schaitberger praised Perez as a ""a tireless advocate for civil and human rights"" who can transcend what the union president called ""a narrow focus on identity and cultural politics that alienated"" some longtime Democrats from the party.

""Tom Perez is the person who has the right mix of personal background, progressive values, experience and total commitment to all workers, in all regions and states across the country,"" Schaitberger said. ""To have Tom Perez as the Chair of one of our nation's two major political parties would be a significant victory for workers across America.""

Perez, the son of Dominican immigrants, has been leaning on his heritage to appeal to Latino DNC members. But Schaitberger, whose union is on the conservative end of the spectrum, said the Labor Secretary is the best person to reorient the party around ""a strong economic message that is truly inclusive of everyone.""

Ellison, an African-American convert to Islam who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary, has faced questions over past associations with Nation of Islam founder Louis Farrakhan, whom he long ago disowned.

Schaitberger earlier spoke out against the AFL-CIO's endorsement process, which gave its executive committee members only three options: Vote to endorse Ellison, abstain, or make no endorsement.

That vote was an attempt to present a united front from the labor movement, which is well represented among the voting members of the DNC, and to avoid a damaging intraparty squabble.

But the IAFF is the second major union in the AFL-CIO to back Perez, and more defections may come.

On Friday, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union  one of the country's largest unions, with 1.3 million members  came out in support of the labor secretary, saying its members ""saw firsthand his passion and commitment"" to their issues during his work heading the Department of Labor.

Another union, the United Farm Workers, endorsed Perez on Monday. Their membership is small, but the endorsement comes with a symbolic connection to famed labor leader Cesar Chavez, who founded the union.

""He has been a lifelong friend of labor and immigrants. When farm workers needed him, Tom Perez stood up and fought,"" said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez, noting it was the first time the union has ever endorsed in a DNC chair race. ""He played a key role in helping farm workers in California win the same overtime pay protections as all other workers, and in doing so is helping end 78 years of race-based discrimination.""

However, Ellison has the backing of a number of powerful individual unions in addition to the AFL-CIO, including two of the very biggest: The American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

""From his time as U.S. Attorney to his tenure as attorney general for the state of Alabama, Jeff Sessions successfully prosecuted drug and violent criminals, corrupt politicians and white collar offenders and his record shows an absolute commitment to equal justice under law by putting the people first  not powerful special interests,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network.

Related: Trump Taps Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for Attorney General Post

Now the battle lines are being drawn over his nomination.

Sessions has a controversial past on issues of race and immigration, including his failed confirmation of a federal judgeship 30 years ago largely because of racially insensitive remarks.

In the 1980s, Sessions was considered for a Ronald Reagan-appointed federal district judgeship in Alabama, but was blocked by the Senate after a black former deputy, Thomas Figures, accused him of making racially insensitive statements. Figures said that Sessions called him ""boy"" and had once warned him to be careful about what he said to ""white folks."" Sessions denied the remarks under oath at the time. In addition, U.S. Attorney E.T. Rolison and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ginny Grenade - two people Figures said were in the room at the time of the alleged remarks -- signed affidavits saying they did not hear Sessions call Figures ""boy."" Grenade signed the affidavit in 1986 and Rolison signed one on December 8 of 2016.

Figures, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Alabama, also testified that, during a 1981 murder investigation tied to the Ku Klux Klan, Sessions commented that he ""used to think they [the KKK] were OK"" until he found out some were ""pot smokers."" Sessions claimed he had been joking.

Now, progressives are pouncing.

The progressive group People for the American Way has drawn attention to missing information that Sessions failed to include in a vast questionnaire that he is required to fill out ahead of his confirmation hearings.

In a 10-page memo that outlines Sessions' omissions, PFAW notes that in response to questions about his public statements, Sessions listed 48 opinion articles that he wrote. But the group found 43 more. He also didn't include any of the 60 press releases from 2003 and 2004, including one on the Federal Marriage Amendment, according to the group. Nor did Sessions make mention of his failed nomination to be a federal judge from 20 years ago.

""Sessions' questionnaire is grossly incomplete  we've found hundreds of relevant missing documents in just a few days,"" said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way. ""It's ridiculous to think that the Senate could possibly give thorough consideration to a nominee with this many holes in his questionnaire.""

In response, Sessions submitted two additional pages of information on Thursday, including the listing of his judicial nomination.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the incoming ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is urging Republicans to delay the confirmation hearing.

In a letter to the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Feinstein suggested that a delay of the hearings might be necessary for two reasons: Sessions' incomplete questionnaire and the reams of information that the committee must investigate in less than a month. She noted that Sessions has more than 30 years of public service and public statements that must be analyzed, and the 150,000 pages of information he handed over, while not a complete accounting, is too much to assess before January 10.

""Staff must have sufficient time to do the due diligence on any nominee for this vital position  and this due diligence will likely take longer than the review for recent, prior nominees who had less materials to analyze,"" Feinstein wrote.

Drew Courtney, communications director for PFAW, said: ""No matter who the nominee is, the confirmation process for an attorney general needs to be taken seriously; Given Donald Trump's dismissive attitude towards the Constitution, that's doubly true this year. Senator Grassley is doing the country a real disservice by trying to rush the process.""

But Sen. Grassley has indicated that he has no intention of postponing the hearings. ""It is no surprise that Senator Sessions' twenty years of service as our colleaguenot to mention his service in the Department of Justice and to the State of Alabamayielded an extensive record,"" Grassley wrote in a letter responding to Feinstein.

Severino defended Sessions in a statement. ""Senator Sessions has turned over more material than any nominee in history and is well known to the senators. Liberals are scrambling to delay because they don't want an attorney general who puts the American people and the rule of law ahead of political agendas,"" Severino said.

So many people visited the federal government website that the administration extended the deadline until early next week to give more people time to sign up for what could be the last year of Obamacare coverage.

The Republicans who will control Congress and the White House starting next month say they'll repeal the law that provides the insurance markets as soon as they can  although there's no clear plan for how, when or what to put in its place.

Obama plugged the health insurance marketplace, the centerpiece of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, in his last press conference of the year before heading to Hawaii for vacation.

""Yesterday was the biggest day ever for Healthcare.gov. More than 670,000 Americans signed up to get coverage,"" Obama said.

""SINCE I SIGNED OBAMACARE INTO LAW, OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ADDED MORE THAN 15 MILLION NEW JOBS.""
That's compared to 600,000 sign-ups last year on the Dec. 15 deadline.

Obama said when he took office, 44 million Americans lacked health insurance. ""Today, we have covered more than 20 million of them,"" he said. ""For the first time in history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured.""

Republican opponents of Obamacare don't dispute the coverage numbers but say the law has failed to bring down costs for consumers, as had been promised.

Premiums have risen as insurance companies taking part in the exchanges have struggled to make the profits they seek given the other restrictions imposed by the law. Obamacare limits the ability to charge higher premiums for women and older people, and it forces insurers to take all comers, even people who are already sick.

But the publicity over higher premiums didn't seem to scare off new customers. The Department of Health and Human Services said more than 4 million people have signed up for coverage on Healthcare.gov, compared to about 2.8 million enrollments by the first week of December last year. That includes 1.1 million people not covered before and 2.9 million renewals.

""YESTERDAY WAS BIGGEST DAY EVER FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV. MORE THAN 670,000 AMERICANS SIGNED UP TO GET COVERAGE.""
Most people who buy private insurance on the health insurance marketplaces get a hefty federal subsidy to help pay the premiums. An analysis by the Center for Health and Economy found those subsidies would cost $42.6 billion next year, an increase of nearly $10 billion over this year.

The enrollment numbers do not include 12 health insurance marketplaces run by states and Washington, D.C. independently of the federal government.

The new demand could help improve profitability for insurers, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ""If the current (Affordable Care Act) open enrollment period is successful and enrollment grows, it means the insurance market is not collapsing,"" he said via Twitter.

""Because of the extraordinary demand, we extended the deadline to sign-up for January 1 coverage by two business days until 11:59 pm PST December 19. We don't yet know how many people will take advantage of this extension, but nearly a million consumers left their contact information to hold their place in line,"" HHS said in a statement.

Obama on Friday took a shot at critics who said the law would hurt business and employment by requiring larger employers to cover their workers.

""Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs,"" he said.",2
"129","178.txt","Obama Designates Atlantic, Arctic Areas Off-Limits To Offshore Drilling","President Obama has indefinitely blocked offshore drilling in areas of the Atlantic Ocean and in Arctic waters, a move aimed at advancing environmental protection during his final days in office.

The Arctic protections are a joint partnership with Canada. ""These actions, and Canada's parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth,"" the White House said in a statement.

""They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region's harsh conditions is limited,"" the White House added. ""By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region  at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.""


This map shows the Atlantic areas that have been designated off limits to oil and gas explorations and development activity.
White House
Obama's action designates 31 Atlantic canyons ""off limits to oil and gas exploration and development activity,"" totaling 3.8 million acres, according to the administration. It provides the same protections to much of the Arctic's waters, covering the ""vast majority of U.S. waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas,"" totaling 115 million acres. Canada is doing the same to ""all Arctic Canadian waters,"" the joint statement adds.

Obama took these actions by invoking a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives the president the authority to withdraw lands from oil and gas leases. But as NPR's Jeff Brady and Jennifer Ludden report, major questions remain about what will happen if the incoming Trump administration attempts to reverse this action.

""The White House says the president is acting within his authority, that Presidents of both parties have done this in the past, and trying to reverse such an order would be unprecedented if Trump tried to do this,"" Jeff said on All Things Considered.

There is no legal precedent for reversal, Jeff reports. ""So if there's a legal challenge, and I'm not going to be surprised if there is one, it's really not clear what a court would decide.""


This map shows the area that the U.S. has designated as indefinitely off limits to offshore oil and gas leasing.
White House
As Bloomberg reports, the ""statute doesn't include a provision for reversal and that action may take years to work its way through court.""

Environmental groups such as Oceana are celebrating the designation. ""President Obama has taken a key step in protecting important areas of the Atlantic Ocean from offshore drilling,"" as Jacqueline Savitz, the group's senior vice president for the United States, said in a statement. ""The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in Washington.""

Representatives of the oil and gas industry are unhappy about the news. ""We think it's a very short-sighted decision to take these areas off limits,"" Andy Radford, senior policy advisor for offshore issues at the American Petroleum Institute, told Jeff the action poses ""great risk to our energy security going forward and eliminates the opportunity to create jobs and help small businesses throughout the country. ""

Earlier this year, the Obama administration reversed course on a plan that would have allowed Atlantic offshore drilling after uproar from local communities and environmentalists.

Then, the administration designated the first national marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that it has protected an Atlantic area about the size of New Jersey from deep-sea commercial fishing.",2
"130","179.txt","After Diplomat's Killing, Russia Doubles Down On Ties With Turkey","Tuesday was supposed to be a day of triumph for Russian diplomacy, when Russia aimed to replace the United States as the indispensable power in the Middle East. Instead, it became a day of mourning, with a Turkish honor guard in Ankara loading the flag-draped coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov onto a Moscow-bound plane.

Karlov, who was assassinated in an Ankara art gallery Monday evening, had been given the delicate mission of patching up relations after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane last year. On Tuesday, Karlov's efforts were to be crowned by a meeting in Moscow of the foreign and defense ministers of Russia, Turkey and Iran  and the rise of a new power constellation in the Middle East.

Those talks went ahead despite his death. Afterward, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared the three-country format ""the most effective"" in resolving the Syrian conflict, since his talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had run aground. Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, accused Russia and Iran of bearing responsibility for ""atrocities"" committed during the Syrian government's assault on the city of Aleppo.

With a lame-duck administration in the White House for the next month, Russia is using territorial gains in Syria to seize the diplomatic initiative as well. Because the Syrian government's retaking of Aleppo has happened so fast, Lavrov agreed to move up the Moscow meeting with his Turkish and Iranian colleagues by a week.

That's why the reaction to Karlov's murder  by an off-duty Turkish policeman who shouted about avenging the carnage in Aleppo before being shot to death himself  was practically unanimous in Moscow. The official line from Russian President Vladimir Putin on down was that the assassination in Ankara was a ""provocation"" meant to derail the talks.


Members of a Turkish honor guard carry the coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at the airport in Ankara.

When Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 warplane along the Turkey-Syria border in November 2015, Putin's response was fast and furious. Diplomatic and economic relations were put on hold until last summer, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally issued an apology.

On Monday, the blame in Moscow for the ambassador's killing was assigned to unnamed forces that are opposed to Russia and Turkey's rapprochement. Putin talked on the phone with Erdogan, who agreed to let in a team of Russian investigators.

Putin needs Erdogan, and Erdogan needs Putin. The two leaders are facing isolation from traditional partners because of their policies against domestic opponents and militant nostalgia for bygone empires. What to do about Syria  once a bone of contention between Russia and Turkey  has become an opportunity for both countries to act as power brokers in a global crisis.

The importance of that relationship is clear from the number of contacts the two countries have had since Erdogan's conciliatory visit to Russia back in August. In the space of the past month, Putin has been on the phone with Erdogan half a dozen times, and the Turkish leader is expected to travel to Russia again in January.

Just a little more than a year ago, Putin was accusing Erdogan of ""a stab in the back"" and estimated ISIS oil sales via Turkey in the hundreds of millions  if not billions  of dollars.

Now, responsibility for Karlov's assassination is being attributed to powers farther afield.

""Murder of our ambassador is continuation of information war against Russia. Media hysteria created conditions for it. Info attacks lead to terrorist attacks,"" Russian senator Alexei Pushkov tweeted on Tuesday.

Russian nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who happens to hold a degree in Turkish studies, didn't shy away from blaming the West directly.

""Turkey is turning away from the West. That's disadvantageous for certain Western intelligence agencies,"" Zhirinovsky said on state television Monday night.

The European Union and NATO are afraid that Russia will join forces with Iran and Turkey, he said, presenting the West with a formidable counterweight. So far, Karlov's efforts to that end have not been in vain.",2
"131","180.txt","Senate Democrats plan to run their Trump playbook against Tillerson","Congress is preparing to do major battle next month over President-elect Donald Trumps secretary-of-state nominee, Rex Tillerson, in a brewing proxy fight over Trumps potential financial conflicts of interest and his unconventional foreign policy.

The official sparring is expected to take place on Jan. 11, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to hold a two-part hearing to grill Tillerson over his tenure as ExxonMobils chief executive and what many lawmakers see as unseemly links to Russia.

But behind the scenes on Capitol Hill, the strategizing has already begun.

Democrats do not think they stand much chance of stopping Tillerson from being confirmed. But they plan to press the top diplomat-designate to commit to full divestiture from Exxon and detail how he would pursue a different approach to the world as secretary of state, in what one Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to candidly discuss strategy called a very thorough, tough vetting. As they have with Trump, Democrats plan to focus sharply on potential conflicts of interest deriving from Tillersons finances, as well as his views on critical foreign-policy matters.

Its a grilling they would happily give Trump, if only they had reason to drag him before a congressional committee.

Already, the minority party is railing against Republicans for refusing to demand Tillerson produce his tax returns. Their frustration stems from Tillersons response to a routine question about tax returns on the Foreign Relations Committees pre-hearing questionnaire. According to a Senate Democratic aide and a Trump transition team spokesman, Tillerson said he stood ready to provide only tax return information for himself and his wife for the previous three years. That means its possible Tillerson isnt willing to provide complete returns.

 
A battle is brewing over secretary of state-designate Rex Tillersons nomination on Capitol Hill. (Evan Vucci/AP)
Democrats have demanded that all Trumps Cabinet nominees release their tax returns  something Trump himself steadfastly refused to do during the campaign, because, he said, the returns were under routine audit.

Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said the GOP would not break with years of precedent to compel Tillerson to turn over his tax returns without good reason, no matter how loud the clamor from Democrats. Unless there was a case where theres some irregularity thats known, the committee just does not ask for tax returns, Corker said in an interview.

Corker said Tillerson is not going to be the proxy [for Trump], because were not going to ask for tax returns.

I understand there are a number of Democrats who are very upset about President-elect Trump not putting his tax returns, Corker said. But thats not going to change the way we go about our committee process.

Senate Democrats believe they can fight miniature versions of the political battles they are waging with Trump during the confirmation hearings for his Cabinet choices  particularly those such as Tillerson who hail from the private sector. They intend to focus on Tillersons four-decade career at a major oil conglomerate and what they  and some Republicans  see as questionable ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several Democratic members of the committee have said they also plan to ask Tillerson about human rights and climate change in light of his Exxon work.

Many lawmakers are leaning on Trump to fully divest from his companies because his wide-ranging business empire lends itself at the very least to an appearance of conflicts of interest. Democrats argue Tillersons business career raises similar questions.

Just how thorny those conflicts may be wont be clear until the committee receives Tillersons financial disclosure statements, documents that Corker expects to have before the end of 2016. Corker plans to give other committee members a copy of the disclosure as soon as we have it, providing ample time to review what is expected to be a very extensive document.

Committee Democrats are planning to scour Tillersons financials once they receive them and are exploring options to beef up their resources by borrowing tax and financial experts from other corners of the Hill or seconding Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department employees to help, according to an aide.

The all-in effort is vital, they argue, because unlike many previous secretaries of state, Tillerson has not had to publicize details about his personal finances. If confirmed, Tillerson would be the first secretary of state in decades who has not previously worked as a public servant or a member of the military.

This proposed nominee for secretary of state will likely be asked more questions than normal. Secretary Kerry was somebody that we knew. Secretary Clinton was somebody that we knew, Corker said. Since [Tillerson] will be up under the hood advising the president on foreign policy, a president who hasnt been involved in foreign policy in his business life, we certainly want to understand fully the kind of advice he would be giving the president as secretary of state.

Part of the logic behind planning a two-part hearing (one session in the morning and one in the afternoon), as Corker put it, is so there can be plenty, plenty, plenty of time for people to learn everything they want to from Tillerson.

A particular point of concern for Democrats and Republicans will be Tillersons relationship and business dealings with Putin, who awarded him the Kremlins Order of Friendship in 2013. Tillerson also opposed sanctions that the United States imposed on Russia in 2014 as a reaction to the annexation of Crimea and Moscows support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, arguing that Exxon lost $1 billion from the policy change.

On Thursday, Corker had a 30-minute conversation with Tillerson in which he questioned him about Russia, with the bulk of that conversation focusing on sanctions. He came away with the impression that Tillerson had no interest in ripping up existing sanctions on Russia, even if he criticized them as Exxons CEO.

That would be hugely problematic to this one senator, if I felt that was how we were going to begin the relations with Russia, Corker said, referring to himself. He noted the conversation alleviated some of the concerns he harbored about Tillersons relationship with the Kremlin.

Corker said he encouraged Tillerson to start calling other lawmakers on his committee. Tillerson and lead Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Ben Cardin (Md.) also spoke by phone Thursday, but a spokesman for Cardin would not detail what was discussed.

On Tuesday, Tillerson was in Washington, where he met with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who endorsed his nomination. He hopes to meet with as many senators as possible to discuss his nomination, according to the Trump transition team.

I think, at least I hope, that when these meetings take place that were going to see a Rex Tillerson that has a standard view of Russias malicious activities, nefarious activities, Corker said. I got a good sense of how hed [approach] Russia and Putin, and it was certainly different, if you will, than the picture of him toasting Putin with champagne.

Several key GOP senators  including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.)  have expressed concerns that Tillersons ties to Russia could be a dangerous echo of Trumps seeming affinity for Putin. Those concerns have taken on even more urgency in wake of CIA allegations that Russia attempted to tilt the election to Trump.

Since the president-elect selected Tillerson, Trumps transition team has been rolling out foreign policy heavyweights such as Bob Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and Dick Cheney to vouch for Tillersons global bona fides. Gates, Rice and Hadley run a consulting firm that has Exxon is a client.

Only one Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee  Rubio  has publicly criticized Tillerson over his Kremlin ties, and he communicated those concerns directly to Corker before the nomination was formally announced.

Democrats need only persuade one Republican to oppose Tillerson to block his nomination in committee. But it is still possible he could get to a floor vote even if the committee rejects him. In the past, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported out nominations unfavorably, a procedure that expresses the members discontent without blocking the full Senate from voting. In 1983, the full Senate confirmed President Ronald Reagans Arms Control and Disarmament Agency nominee, Kenneth Adelman, despite his rejection by the panel.

But Corker expressed confidence that Tillerson would pass the committees test, even if his track record as an oil-company CEO gives members pause.

My sense is, based on the conversation we had, hes going to very much understand that his job now is to pursue our countrys national interest, Corker said.",2
"132","181.txt","Newt Gingrich says Trump is done with drain the swamp","There were two notable Trumpworld headlines Wednesday morning. One was the news that Corey Lewandowski  Donald Trump's former campaign manager who remained part of his inner circle long after leaving that job  had just opened a full service government relations and consulting firm half a block from the White House.

The other was that the president-elect is apparently over drain the swamp.

That's according to Newt Gingrich, a top ally who told NPR in an interview that aired Wednesday morning that he was instructed not to use the phrase anymore because it has fallen out of favor with Trump.

I'm told he now just disclaims that, Gingrich said on Morning Edition. He now says it was cute, but he doesn't want to use it anymore.

Gingrich said he had written what I thought was a very cute tweet about 'the alligators are complaining,'"" but that somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.

Gingrich actually drafted two tweets in recent days about draining the swamp  tweets that apparently earned him the rebuke.


But this should really come as no surprise. Trump himself has acknowledged his on-again, off-again relationship with the phrase. And it actually wasn't a mainstay in the campaign until the final days.

Trump freely admitted that he never much liked the phrase, in fact. But he said that his crowds had prevailed upon him to embrace it.

""'Drain the swamp.' We put it in about two days ago. I said, 'Drain the swamp.' I didn't like it. I didn't like the expression: 'Drain the swamp in Washington,'"" Trump said Oct. 26 at a rally in North Carolina. So I said it three days ago; the place went crazy. I said, 'You know what? I'm starting to like that expression.' And now it's a hot  it's like trending all over the world.

Trump explains why he didnt like the phrase drain the swamp but now does  Play Video0:39
At a rally in Kinston, N.C., Oct. 26, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump said the phrase drain the swamp had been trending all over the world since he started using it. (The Washington Post)
As admissions of political expediency go, this is pretty forthcoming.

But it's also worth noting here that Trump's flip on this phrase seems to have come pretty suddenly. Just a day before Gingrich's first tweet above, Trump promised in Alabama to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. He said the same in Orlando the day before and in Hershey, Pa., the day before that.

So it's not clear whether a specific story or cable news item  which have a tendency to draw instant Trump policy directives and declarations  might have influenced this change of course, if indeed it sticks. But what's clear is that Trump's efforts to drain the swamp have increasingly been derided and scoffed at as he has named a Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury Department and politicians and fellow billionaires to lead other departments. And then there are the many possible conflicts of interest.

"133","182.txt","Donald Trumps doctor: If something happens to him, then it happens to him","Donald Trump's campaign and its supporters spent a good portion of the 2016 campaign arguing that Hillary Clinton was secretly very ill and not up to the task of being president.

Trump's doctor, by contrast, isn't too worried about his patient dying in office  at least, not when it comes to the future of the country.

If something happens to him, then it happens to him, Harold Bornstein says. Its like all the rest of us, no? Thats why we have a vice president and a speaker of the House and a whole line of people. They can just keep dying.

That amazing quote comes courtesy of a new interview Bornstein did with STAT. And it's part of a veritable murderer's row of curmudgeonly quotes from and anecdotes about the .?.?. well .?.?. interesting physician.

A few other quotes from the interview:

About the lack of disclosure about Trump's health and his being the oldest president: There's nothing to share on a regular basis. And: Ronald Reagan had pre-senile dementia. I mean, seriously, did they share that one with you, or did Nancy just cover it up?
Before agreeing to the interview, Bornstein pleaded for the reporter to leave him alone. Please stop this nonsense!!! he said in an email.
On having second thoughts about the interview being published afterward: I happen to have known the Sulzbergers [the family that owns the New York Times] for 50 years. Im going to make sure you dont ever work again if you do this.
Trump isn't an old man the way my grandfather was an old man. But Hillary Clinton: Shes an old lady. Shes an old lady. Its funny, isnt it?
On his son volunteering to work for Trump's campaign: What a great experience, for an 18-year-old to go to Trump Tower in a presidential year, with this character, of all people.
Bornstein, in case you haven't noticed, is kind of like Trump, if Trump were less rich and an eccentric gastroenterologist. Witness this anecdote:

The back of his business cards are written in Italian, with the phrase dottore molto famoso, or very famous doctor, below his name. (For 10 years, he took private Italian lessons from women he found through Craigslist postings, paying them about $60 an hour for weekly sessions, he said.) A photograph of his psychoanalyst hangs in his office. As this reporter left his office, Bornstein pointed out what appeared to be a small, naked doll sitting on the ground  heres a naked doorstop.

Bornstein says he isn't sure whether he'll continue as Trump's physician while Trump serves as president. As a media professional, I think I speak for all of us when I say we'd prefer that he did.",2
"134","183.txt","Feds: Pension Exec Moved $2B for Coke, Hookers, Other Bribes","A former top official at the country's third-largest pension fund and two broker-dealers were charged Wednesday in what a federal prosecutor described as a classic bribery scheme that steered $2 billion in trades in exchange for drugs, prostitutes, vacations and U.S. Open tennis tickets.

""The hard-earned pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement, calling the alleged pay-for-play arrangement a ""classic, quid-pro-quo bribery scheme.""

Navnoor Kang, the ex-head of the $184 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund's fixed income trades, received more than $100,000 worth of bribes in the form of trips, gifts, luxury hotel stays and other payoffs from broker-dealers Deborah Kelley and Gregg Schonhorn, prosecutors said.

Kang, 38, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, on securities fraud, honest service wire fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges.

His attorney, Lauren DeSantis-Then, said her client denies all the charges.

""Mr. Kang is not guilty and we look forward to our day in court,"" she said.

Kelley, 58, of Piedmont, California, was expected to surrender, authorities said. Her attorney didn't immediately return a request for comment.

Schonhorn, 45, of Short Hills, New Jersey, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities, court papers show. His lawyer didn't immediately return a request for comment.

Regulators found that Kang steered about $2 billion in fixed-income trades to firms represented by Kelley and Schonhorn beginning in early 2014, resulting in millions of dollars in commissions, of which the two earned between 35 and 40 percent, according to an indictment.

In that time, securities investigators found that the firms' fixed-income business surged, with one of them increasing its domestic bond transactions from zero at the end of fiscal year 2013 to $2.378 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016, making it one of the top broker dealers doing state pension fund business, according to the complaint.

Prosecutors said that in exchange, Kang received a $10,000 all-expenses-paid trip to Montreal, Canada; a ski trip to Park City, Utah; tickets to a Paul McCartney concert in New Orleans; a $17,420 Panerai wristwatch; dinners at upscale restaurants; nights out at strip clubs; prostitutes; and cocaine.

The state's pension fund has been the source of scandal before.

In 2010, a state comptroller pleaded guilty to charges he steered pension funds to a campaign contributor. Further investigations revealed investors' widespread use of so-called placement agents to access pension funds, an arrangement some regulators have likened to pay-to-play.

Kang had been fired in 2012 by a private investment firm for accepting gifts from Schonhorn in exchange for steering fixed-income business, but he lied about his termination when he was hired by the state fund, according to the complaint.

Asked whether state officials properly investigated Kang before hiring him, a spokesman for the comptroller's office said only that ""background checks are a routine part of the hiring process.""",2

Clinton had been dogged by the issue of her private email server throughout the campaign and Comey dealt a surprise blow when he said that the FBI was looking into the emails found on former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer just days before the election.

According to the warrant and supporting documents, investigators said they found thousands of emails belonging to top Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin on the computer belonging to her estranged husband, Weiner. Both of their names are redacted.

The laptop's hard drive, according to sources, was being examined in unrelated investigations into alleged sexting by Weiner.

Warrant Related to Clinton Emails to Be Unsealed Tuesday
Warrant Obtained to Start Reviewing Emails Found on Laptop Used by Clinton Aide
FBI Says Review of New Emails Doesn't Change Conclusion Clinton Shouldn't Be Charged
When discovered, the FBI believed the emails were ""outside the scope"" of their investigation into Weiner, and did not look at them beyond the subject line and e-mail address information, according to the newly released documents.

According to the affidavit, the FBI had already reviewed more than 30,000 emails and found 2,115 contained classified information, including 22 with Top Secret information.

Analysis of those emails ""revealed more than 4,000 work-related emails between [redacted] and Clinton from 2009 and 2013."" The redaction is believed to refer to Abedin.

According to the affidavit, the FBIs prior investigation found that among the 4,000, some 27 email chains containing classified information ""have been transmitted through [redacted] and/or [redacted] accounts,"" which again are believed to be between Abedin and Clinton.

""Because it has been determined by relevant original classification authorities that many emails were exchanged between [redacted] and/or [redacted] accounts and Clinton that contained classified information, there is also probable cause to believe that the correspondence between them located on Subject Laptop contains classified information,"" the affidavit says.

The FBI search of the laptop came during the final days of the presidential election, months after Comey announced that the bureau had effectively closed its investigation.

E. Randol Schoenberg, a Los Angeles attorney who petitioned to have the documents unsealed, said in a statement to ABC News he was ""appalled.""

""I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Secretary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin,"" he said.

On Oct. 28, Comey disclosed to Congress that the FBI would be looking at the newly discovered emails, but it remains unclear when the emails were discovered and how long it took for that information to be communicated to Comey. The warrant was approved two days later.

Just two days before the election, Comey issued a second letter to Congress, stating, ""based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.""

It's unclear what impact Comey's letters had on the election, but Clinton told top donors that she thought Comey's letter to Congress was a turning point in the contest between her and now President-elect Donald Trump.

Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted today that ""the unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.""

Stephen Saltzburg, George Washington University Law Professor, said that Comey didn't need to ""run the risk"" of making Clinton look even worse right before the election -- a move that broke with FBI protocol about commenting on ongoing investigations.

""They [FBI] had to assure themselves that there was no classified information at risk on a computer that they didnt have. They had no obligation, however, to go public about what they were doing,"" he said.

Officials at both the FBI and the Department of Justice declined to comment to ABC News.",2
"137","186.txt","Clinton FBI Director Backs Trump's Attorney General Pick Jeff Sessions, Defends His Records on Civil Rights","The campaign to rally support for Donald Trumps pick to head the Justice Department is growing, with former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who served under President Bill Clinton, now joining the effort.

In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Freeh offered his strong recommendation that Senators confirm their colleague Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as the next attorney general, defending his record on civil rights, which has become a key concern for critics.

I have known Jeff since 1989 when we worked together as prosecutors on one of the most important civil rights cases investigated and prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice, Freeh wrote. [I] have always been greatly impressed with his commitment to the rule of law, his fair and balanced prosecutorial judgment, and his personal dedication to protecting civil rights.

What Jeff Sessions Has Said About Race and Civil Rights
After Sessions was announced as Trumps pick for attorney general, top Democrats and some civil rights groups expressed concern over decades-old allegations that he made racist remarks when he was U.S. Attorney in Alabama. Others alleged -- under oath during his 1986 confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship -- that he once called a white civil rights lawyer a disgrace to his race and dubbed some efforts by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ""un-American.""

During the hearings, one lawyer who worked with Sessions claimed the lawmaker told him he thought the KKK was ""OK until I found out they smoked pot."" Sessions said the comment was a joke but apologized.

Under oath himself, Sessions also insisted he harbored no racial bias and said the allegations were either false or being taken out of context. He was nevertheless blocked from becoming a judge.

In his letter on Tuesday, Freeh pointed to Sessions work on the 1989 murders of a federal judge in Alabama and an NAACP official in Georgia.

I was struck with Jeffs fierce determination to solve these civil rights murders, which so gravely impacted the rule of law and the guarantee of civil rights in America, Freeh wrote, noting that, Jeff and his office were key decision-makers in formulating and implementing the investigative strategy which ultimately led to the arrest and conviction of Walter Moody for these murders.

Meanwhile, a conservative judicial organization, the Judicial Crisis Network, has created an entire website devoted to pushing Sessions' confirmation.

He is a world-class legal mind and a tough but fair lawyer with invaluable experience, says the website, ConfirmSessions.com. Known for his deep respect for the Constitution and adherence to the rule of law, Sen. Sessions has worked tirelessly to defend the civil rights and legal rights of all Americans.

Democratic Party leaders, meanwhile, have called Sessions nomination deeply troubling.

Over the course of his career, Senator Sessions used the power of the courts to discriminate against civil rights leaders, allegedly used racially charged language to disparage minorities, expressed support for the KKK and then tried to dismiss it as a joke, celebrated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, opposed same-sex marriage, denied the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade, voted against greater access to healthcare for veterans, blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, and voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,"" Democratic National Committee Interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement last month.

Freeh, who served as FBI director from 1993 to June 2001, expressed no such concerns, calling Sessions a friend who has had a distinguished career in public service.

I believe that Jeff will be an outstanding Attorney General for the Nation, Freeh said.",2

Opening Day is your opportunity to play a significant role as our family commemorates the inauguration of our father, friend and President Donald J. Trump. Join us as we celebrate the great American tradition of outdoor sporting, shooting, fishing and conservation, reads a draft of the invitation, first obtained by TMZ. The draft invitation also listed Mr. Trumps two adult sons as honorary co-chairmen of the event.

But Tuesday afternoon, Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks denied the involvement of Mr. Trumps sons. 

The Opening Day event and details that have been reported are merely initial concepts that have not been approved or pursued by the Trump family, said Hicks in a statement. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are avid outdoorsmen and supporters of conservation efforts, which align with the goals of this event, however they are not involved in any capacity. 

In a call with reporters Wednesday, the transition team repeated that the Trump sons would have no involvement with the event itself. 

According to the New York Times, the event is still scheduled, but references to the hunting trip have been removed. 

The Camouflage & Cufflinks-themed evening will still be held at a convention center in Washington, D.C. on January 21, the day following Mr. Trumps inauguration to the White House.

Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise, said a spokesperson for the worlds largest retailer, with more than $482 billion in revenue. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the bulletproof reference.

The head of the Fraternal Order of Police wrote an open letter to Walmart Tuesday night requesting that the company to take down Black Lives Matter merchandise from its website. 

Canterbury wrote that the clothing would damage your companys good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers. The FOP calls itself the worlds largest law enforcement group, claiming more than 330,000 members in 2,200 lodges.

At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division, he added.

The right-wing website Breitbart drew attention to the presence of Black Lives Matter shirts on Walmarts site earlier this month, which prompted some on Twitter to call for a boycott of the retailer. 

Like many retailers doing business online, Walmart offers merchandise from third-party sellers on its website, which can be distinguished by a small note on the product page.

"140","189.txt","Report: Trump team questions costs of State Department's environment efforts","Donald Trumps transition team is asking State Department officials to reveal how much of their funding goes towards international environmental groups, according to a new Washington Post report. 

The query, posed in a list of questions to the State Departments Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, asked, How much does the Department of State contribute annually to international environmental organizations in which the department participates?

State Department spokesperson John Kirby noted Wednesday, however, that there is nothing out of hte norm regarding questions being asked by the transition team. 

The questions, Kirby told reporters, were very much aligned with their need to better understand the bureaucracy and organization that theyre about to lead. 

Nothing falls outside the normal inquiries, Kirby said. 

Despite State Department assurances, the inquiry has increased worries that the president-elects transition team is prioritizing a rollback of the Obama administrations actions on climate change and conservation efforts. 

While Mr. Trump has met with prominent climate change activists since his election victory, the president-elect has also tapped several people to lead government agencies that have agendas contrary to Mr. Obamas own climate and renewable fuel focus. For instance, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt -- who Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency -- is a vocal denier of climate change science and has even sued the Obama administration over its clean power plant rules. Mr. Trumps pick for secretary of state, oil magnate Rex Tillerson, has said climate change could pose significant risks, but there is little indication that the Exxon Mobil executive will prioritze the issue. 

Mr. Trump also threatened during his campaign to scuttle the United States involvement in the landmark Paris climate change accord, an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions and try to reverse global warming effects. The Paris treaty holds the U.S. accountable for donating $3 billion over four years to the Green Climate Fund, which is devoted to helping poorer countries weather the detrimental effects of climate change.

Similarly, the Energy Department was also recently sent a questionnaire to divulge the names of employees who had worked on climate change policies. The department said it would not be complying with that request, and the Trump transition team disavowed the original questionnaire, saying it was not authorized.

The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment confirming the Post report.

According to the White Houses Office of Management and Budget, of the State Departments 2016 budget of $30.91 billion, about $128 million was allocated for natural resources and the environment.  ",2
"141","190.txt","North Carolina legislators to reconsider transgender bathroom bill","RALEIGH, N.C.  Legislators who passed the North Carolina law known as the bathroom bill nine months ago head back to the capital on Wednesday to consider repealing it. But theres uncertainty over exactly what lawmakers will do, in part because this Republican-controlled legislature has shown a willingness to go its own way, despite intense outside pressure to scrap the law.

Legislators returned to Raleigh for a special session called by GOP Gov. Pat McCrory to eliminate House Bill 2 -- the bathroom bill -- which has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in job losses and sporting event cancellations. 

No repeal bill backed by Republicans had been made public by midday. Instead, House Republicans returned to a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning that continued into the afternoon. They held a similar meeting that lasted for more than four hours Tuesday night. Some Republicans were unhappy after learning that Charlotte on Monday had not repealed its entire nondiscrimination ordinance, which had been the genesis of HB2, Republican repeal supporter Rep. Chuck McGrady said. 

On a difficult issue where the parties dont have a lot of trust, we got thrown a curveball by the less than full repeal by Charlotte, McGrady tweeted early Wednesday. 

The fact that McCrory called lawmakers back to Raleigh a month before their 2017 sessions start was challenged by an opponent of HB2s repeal. 

There is no extraordinary circumstance, said Rep. Jeff Collins, R-Nash, during a brief debate over session procedures, other than the extraordinary hubris of a city council telling us we have to act by a certain date. Mondays action by the Charlotte council was contingent on HB2s repeal by Dec. 31.  

Over the past year, there has been bitter fighting between Democrats and Republicans. Just last week, Republican leaders convened a surprise legislative session and passed two laws designed to bring Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Coopers powers in check when he becomes governor Jan. 1.

Cooper blasted McCrory over House Bill 2 during the governors race, and the fallout over the law  job losses, canceled concerts and sporting events  contributed to McCrorys narrow defeat. The wide-ranging law is best known for requiring transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings.

GOP Rep. Chuck McGrady of Hendersonville supports repealing the entire law and said he believes a significant number of House members from both parties do as well.

Everybody is acting in good faith in my opinion, McGrady said. House Republicans met by phone Monday and would meet in person in Raleigh later Tuesday, he said.

However, lawmakers were already under pressure from some conservative groups to keep HB2 in place.

Were sending the message to our supporters that lawmakers should not now betray people who supported them and compromise common-sense principles like privacy, dignity and freedom from our citizens, said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition.

House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger have only issued a brief statement Monday, saying they would take up the repeal of HB2. They also criticized Cooper for taking too much credit.

They did not return messages for comment Tuesday.

Charlotte appears to have held up its end of the bargain, but the measure enacted Monday notes that its dependent on HB2 being repealed in its entirety by Dec. 31. That could give some lawmakers justification not to repeal it.

Cooper, who helped broker Charlottes cooperation with phone calls over the weekend, expects a full repeal, his spokeswoman Megan Jacobs said late Monday.

The law also limits statewide protections for LGBT people in public accommodation and employment, and it reinforced a prohibition on local governments from raising minimum wage. Local governments are also prevented from enacting nondiscrimination measures that would go further than state law.

The session is scheduled several days before Christmas, with some legislators out of town.

GOP Rep. Jeff Collins of Rocky Mount, who voted for HB2 in March, told The Wilson Times that he was not interested in repealing anything. I think we did the right thing the first time, he told the newspaper.

Passing a repeal would only require a handful of GOP support  perhaps 10 in the Senate or 15 in the House  if all Democrats voted for it.

Discussions about repealing the law increased after decisions by the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move their championship events out of North Carolina this academic year. The NBA also moved an All-Star Game out of Charlotte.

Democratic Rep. Grier Martin of Raleigh said until theres a full repeal, Im pretty certain that were not going to see another NBA All-Star Game or NCAA tournament game in North Carolina.

LGBT advocates said they were cautiously hopeful.

We are holding out hope that the legislators will keep their word, said Simone Bell, Southern Regional Director for the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal. We want complete and full repeal of HB 2.",2
"142","191.txt","After violence abroad, Trump meeting with security adviser","PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump is planning to meet with his incoming national security adviser in the aftermath of a rattling day of violence around the world.

Trump appeared to jump ahead of investigators in blaming Islamic terrorists for deadly incidents Monday in Turkey and Germany and vowing anew to eradicate their regional and global networks. He called the brazen shooting of Russias ambassador to Turkey a violation of all rules of civilized order. He added that a radical Islamic terrorist had assassinated the diplomat, Andrei Karlov.

Turkish authorities identified the gunman as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a member of Ankaras riot police squad, and said he was later killed in a shootout with police. Altintas shouted in Turkish about the Syrian city of Aleppo and also yelled Allahu akbar, Arabic for God is great.

President-elect Trump describes mission to fight terrorism
As for Berlin, where at least 12 people were killed and nearly 50 hurt when a truck plowed through a Christmas market, Trump said the Islamic State group and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. A man held by German authorities after the violence was later released after a lack of evidence to connect him to the incident.

Trumps meeting scheduled Wednesday with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will come a day after Flynn and several other members of the incoming national security team met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Washington. Aides said the meeting was planned before the acts of violence, though they were discussed.

The gathering with Pence included retired Gen. John Kelly, Trumps nominee for head of the Department of Homeland Security; retired Gen. James Mattis, the pick for defense secretary; and Rex Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil and the intended nominee for secretary of state.

While Trump has assembled his Cabinet at a quick pace, the process to fill out top White House jobs has been slowed by infighting among advisers. Some of Trumps earliest advisers have expressed concern to the president-elect himself that they are getting boxed out in favor of those more closely aligned with incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has chaired the Republican National Committee.

Among those whose future is still in flux is Corey Lewandowski, Trumps controversial first campaign manager who was fired after clashing with the president-elects family. On Monday, Lewandowski met with Jared Kushner, Trumps influential son-in-law, and could still be offered a job in the administration, though potentially one that would keep him out of the West Wing - and away from the president.

The president-elects transition team has said it expects to announce some White House positions in the coming days.

Former FBI agent on how Berlin terror attack differs from Nice
Trump met Tuesday with candidates for his unfilled Cabinet positions, including prospective hires to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, a beleaguered agency that the Republican businessman has vowed to overhaul.

At Mar-a-Lago, Trumps palatial Florida estate, the president-elect met with Luis Quinonez, who runs a company with military and health care ties and is said to be under consideration for VA secretary. He also interviewed Toby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, who was a top contender to replace Eric Shinseki when he resigned from the VA in 2014. Cosgrove later withdrew from consideration.

Trump repeatedly pledged during the campaign to fix the woes at the department and said he would take care of great veterans. But he also came under scrutiny for being slow in paying out money raised for veterans groups and for suggesting that strong veterans dont need treatment for mental health problems.

Others said to be considered for the post include former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Florida Rep. Jeff Miller and Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and former CEO of Concerned Veterans for America.

Trump is also considering Jovita Carranza, who worked in President George W. Bushs administration, as his choice for U.S. trade representative. She served as deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration under Bush.

With just a handful of Cabinet posts to fill, Trump is facing some criticism for a lack of diversity in his senior team, which currently includes no Hispanics. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said Tuesday that it was deeply concerned at the lack of Hispanics considered for top jobs. Carranza was a member of Trumps Hispanic advisory council during the campaign.

Pence, meanwhile, met in Washington with former Texas state official Susan Combs, who served both as state agriculture commissioner and comptroller. Trump also needs to fill the Agriculture Department slot. Transition officials did not immediately confirm if Combs is up for that post.",2
"143","192.txt","Which candidates did the seven ""faithless"" electors support?","A historic number of faithless electors -- seven in total--each cast their ballots on Monday for a candidate other than the one who won his or her state. What may be more surprising, given the level of protests against Donald Trump and the pressure exerted on Republican electors, is that a greater number were untrue to Hillary Clinton than to Mr. Trump.

Among the 538 electors chosen to represent their states in the Electoral College, five were faithless to the Democratic nominee and two to the Republican. Prior to this year, there hasnt been more than one faithless elector in any presidential election since 1948.

What is next for the Electoral College?
Among the Democratic faithless electors was David Mulinix, of Hawaii, who cast his vote for Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton. He said he believes the Electoral College is outdated, according to Hawaii News Now, which also pointed out that though Hawaii forbids faithless electors, Mulinixs vote still counted and he would face no punishment because Hawaii has never bothered to come up with a penalty for breaking the law.

Four of the faithless electors came from Washington, a state won by Clinton. Three of them--Bret Chiafalo, 19-year-old Levi Guerra, and Esther John-- cast their votes for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, according to the Seattle Times. They also participated in a movement started by Chiafalo. The so-called Hamilton Electors base their ideology on Alexander Hamilton--one of the Founding Fathers who wrote about the Electoral College in the Federalist Papers.  

The fourth faithless elector, Robert Satiacum, voted for Faith Spotted Eagle--a woman who is a member of the Yankton Sioux Nation, according to a local NBC affiliate. She played a public role in opposing the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.

President-elect Trump lost Texas elector Christopher Suprun to John Kasich. Another Texas elector, Bill Greene, voted for Libertarian Ron Paul, according to the Texas Monthly. 

Though there is no Constitutional provision or federal law barring electors from voting for whom they are pledged, more than half of the states, including D.C., bind their electors. The rest of electors may have the legal authority to vote for whomever they want, but, as CBS News previously reported, faithless electors have never decided a presidential election.

The entire procedure lasted well into the evening, with the official tally coming in around 8 p.m--though the president-elect clinched the nomination with the necessary 270 votes earlier in the evening. According to a final tally, Trump received 304 votes compared to Clintons 227.

The votes cast Monday will be sent on to the nations capital by late December. Subsequently, on Jan. 6, Vice President Joe Biden will open the electoral votes before a joint session of the new Congress, where they will be counted one last time.",2

Planned Parenthood will lose the Medicaid funding within 30 days. The organization has 15 days to appeal  by requesting an administrative hearing with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, according to the Tribune. 

Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards responded by calling Texas a cautionary tale for the rest of the nation. The move comes at a time when her organization is simultaneously fighting to stop Congress from also cutting off taxpayer dollars. President-elect Donald Trump has given mixed signals about his feelings toward the group.

"145","194.txt","Obama ""permanently"" bans drilling in parts of Arctic, Atlantic","HONOLULU -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing. 

The move helps put some finishing touches on Mr. Obamas environmental legacy while also testing President-elect Donald Trumps promise to unleash the nations untapped energy reserves. 

The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review.

Mr. Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a 1953 law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that the president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf. 

Environmental groups hope the ban, despite relying on executive powers, will be difficult for future presidents to reverse. The White House said its confident the presidents order will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals. 

The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are 31 canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia, though some had hoped for a more extensive ban that would have extended further south. 

Existing leases arent affected by the presidents executive actions. 

The administration cited environmental concerns in both regions to justify the moratorium. Mr. Obama also cited the importance of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in providing subsistence for native Alaskans and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to an oil spill to justify his directive. 

Mr. Obama also noted the level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic. Mr. Obama said just 0.1 percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in 2015, and at current oil prices, significant production would not occur in future decades. 

Thats why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector, Mr. Obama said. 

Still, industry officials objected to Mr. Obamas memorandum, calling it last minute political rhetoric. 

Instead of building on our nations position as a global energy leader, todays unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come, said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. 

And Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said Mr. Obamas move marginalized local voices. He said no one is more invested than Alaskans in making sure Arctic habitats are protected. 

To lock it up against any further exploration or development activity is akin to saying that the voices of activists who live in Lower 48 cities have a greater stake than those to whom the Arctic is our front yard and our back yard, he said in a statement. 

In issuing a permanent ban, Mr. Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor. Mr. Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Mr. Obamas environmental and climate change actions. 

Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election, but Mr. Trumps victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing. Mr. Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy self-sufficiency - and that its time to open up offshore drilling. 

This decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling, which promises smaller, short-lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods, said Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice president at the advocacy group, Oceana. 

A key question to be answered is how difficult it will be for future presidents to overturn Mr. Obamas decision should they seek to do so. 

The American Petroleum Institute pointed to 2008 when President George W. Bush used a simple memorandum to remove previously withdrawn lands and make all Outer Continental Shelf lands available for leasing except marine sanctuaries. 

Fortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban, said the institutes Erik Milito. 

But White House officials in a conference call with reporters said previous indefinite withdrawals remain in place and voiced confidence that Mr. Obamas decision will stand. 

Advocacy groups were already warning that they were prepared to file suit to protect the ban during future administrations. 

If Donald Trump tries to reverse President Obamas withdrawals, he will find himself in court, said Marissa Knodel of Friends of the Earth. 

Frank Knapp, president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Columbia, said he was extremely disappointed in the decision not to extend drilling protections to the entire Atlantic seaboard. 

Knapp and his group were among a number of business groups in the southeast who had advocated for banning new drilling leases off their shores, arguing that the environmental impacts would hurt fishing, tourism and other businesses the region relies upon. Hed gone to Washington to meet with Obama administration officials, and believed the entire Atlantic was to be protected. 

The decision came as Mr. Obama spends the holidays in Hawaii. Some Democratic lawmakers applauded Obama, while some Republicans were highly critical. 

As President-elect Trump nominates fossil fuel allies to his Cabinet, President Obama has instead put the interests of millions of Americans ahead of those of Big Oil with these permanent protections, said Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. 

The extremes to which this president will go to appease special interests never ceases to amaze, countered Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. This is not a moral calling; its an abuse of power.",2

The warrant was issued on Oct. 30, just two days after FBI Director James Comey had sent a letter to Congress revealing the possible existence of new emails related to the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server.

The Department of Justice had previously announced that the investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information was closed, with a decision not to bring charges against anyone. Comeys letter to Congress said the new emails were discovered as part of an unrelated investigation, but he did not name or give details about the other investigation.

FBI combs through Weiner's computer
According to the warrant, law enforcement officials had asked the judge to authorize the search of a silver Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series laptop computer. The warrant states that those officials had information indicating that there were thousands of emails on the laptop that could be related to the Clinton investigation.

The FBIs application for the search warrant said that the laptop had never been authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information and that a complete forensic analysis and review of the device would allow the FBI to determine whether classified information had been mishandled or if the device had been hacked. 

The warrant was unsealed after E. Random Schoenberg sued to unseal the search warrant. He made it clear he was not interested in the unrelated investigation and was only seeking the warrant for the emails related to Secretary Clinton.

In deciding whether to unseal the warrant, the judge noted that Clinton has little remaining privacy interest in the release of her documents identify her as the subject of her investigation.

The Department of Justice initially opposed the unsealing, then withdrew its opposition and instead asked only that the documents be unsealed with certain redactions. The warrant was redacted to hide the identity of the subject of that other investigation  who has been independently confirmed to be Anthony Weiner. The redactions also protect the identity of the law enforcement agents who worked on the case and applied for the warrant.

Lawyers for Huma Abedin filed a letter in the case saying that the government never provided Abedin or her estranged ex-husband Anthony Weiner with a copy of the warrant.

Under federal law the officer executing the warrant must give a copy to the person whose property is taken.  This case is slightly more complicated by the fact that the laptop had already been confiscated for the other investigation, a sexting scandal involving Weiner and a minor.",2

Trump vows to eradicate Islamic terrorism in response to Berlin attack
The press pool covering him reported, Trump stopped by a staff off the record with reporters at Mar-a-Lago, mingling for about a half hour and according to [Trump press director] Stephanie Grisham decided to go to dinner afterwards. We are told we can report the fact that Trump and Melania stopped by the OTR with reporters.

It is not unusual for elected officials to hold off-the-record meetings with the press -- ostensibly to give journalists insight into the principals thinking on an issue. This particular session took place as journalists continue to protest the fact that Mr. Trump has yet to hold a news conference since his election. Its now been 145 days since his last news conference. He has, since the election, given interviews to CBS News, to New York Times reporters, and to Fox News, but the press conference he was to hold last week about the resolution of his business conflicts was postponed until the new year.  

Mike Allen, formerly of Politico and now of Axios, was there and sent a series of tweets about the meeting in the White and Gold ballroom, saying in one that Mr. Trump was relaxed and chatty and that pictures were allowed of the off-the-record session.


Many of the journalists who attended, including Allen, saw an uptick in outraged tweets aimed at them, though this one, from cartoonist Ann Telnaes, summed up the reaction visually.


In addition to Allen, APs Evan Vucci, Reuters Steve Holland and Jonathan Lucas, ABCs Katherine Faulders and Hallie Jackson, Jeremy Diamond and Noah Gray of CNN, Ali Vitali of NBC, the Washington Posts Jabin Botsford, the New York Times Nick Corasaniti, Buzzfeeds Adrian Carrasquillo and Politicos Tara Palmeri attended, among others.

"149","198.txt","NSA watchdog put on leave in whistleblower case","WASHINGTON -- Allegations of retaliation against a whistleblower at the National Security Agency have left its top watchdog fighting for his job, according to an intelligence official and another individual familiar with the case.

The case could offer some credence to Edward Snowdens claim that he could not have reported the governments domestic surveillance program without facing reprisals.

George Ellard, the NSAs inspector general, was placed on administrative leave after he refused to give the whistleblower a certain job assignment. The Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, first reported last week that Adm. Mike Rogers, director of NSA, had placed Ellard on leave and recommended that he be terminated. Ellard is appealing that decision.

Ellard received attention in 2014 for remarks at Georgetown University Law Center criticizing Snowden, the former NSA contractor who had leaked secret documents about the surveillance program. Snowden says he went public because he feared retaliation from his superiors if he had raised his concerns with them. Ellard said at Georgetown that Snowden could have safely come to him.

Ellards case is the first to move completely through a process created by President Barack Obama in 2012 to ensure that intelligence employees can effectively report waste, fraud and abuse while protecting classified information. The directive prohibits agencies from retaliating against them or taking away security clearances or an employees access to classified information.

The case stemmed from a whistleblowers claims of financial misconduct by NSA officials involving a conference in Nashville, Tennessee.

The whistleblower, in a brief email to The Associated Press, said that after he raised his concerns, his name was disclosed to Ellard in violation of rules intended to protect government employees who want to report misconduct.

The whistleblower said his email response had been cleared by the NSA. The agency declined to comment independently on the case. Ellards attorney did not respond to requests for comment.

Its not clear who revealed the whistleblowers identity to Ellard. But the whistleblower said that after Ellard learned who he was, I was denied an assignment within the NSA inspector generals office of investigations because of my whistleblowing. He sent the email to the AP on condition of anonymity because the case is still active.

Rogers decision to recommend Ellards dismissal followed an eight-month investigation by a panel of inspectors general at the CIA, Treasury and Justice Department, according to an intelligence official, who was not authorized to disclose details about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. The trio was empaneled in October 2015 and issued its decision in May.

The Justice and Defense departments declined to comment on the decision.

Louis Clark, director of the Government Accountability Project, said he was happy that the process set up by Obamas directive was finally being used, but expressed disappointment that it has taken so long for it to happen. It was so slow because the intelligence agencies are extremely hostile to whistleblowing, he said.

The fate of Obamas directive is uncertain. It will be up to Donald Trump, after he becomes president, to decide whether to continue it. Trump has said he doesnt trust the intelligence agencies, but its not clear if that would make him more or less likely to protect whistleblowers.

Timothy Edgar, Obamas first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff, says there is cause for serious concern about the future of whistleblowers.

What were left with, I think, is probably primarily the integrity and bravery of people in the bureaucracy, who, despite those obstacles are willing to say no if they are involved in activities that they think are serious violations of the Constitution, Edgar said.",2
"150","199.txt","Trump protesters plan to open 'movement house' in Washington DC","A group of millennial activists from across the country plan to open a movement house in Washington DC next month, which will serve as a permanent base to protest Donald Trumps presidency.

The organizers are mostly women of color, many of whom campaigned for Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary.

The house, which will be set up by inauguration day on 20 January, has been dubbed District 13, in a reference to a rebellious neighborhood in the Hunger Games books and films.

Activists told the Guardian that it will serve as a space for the best kinds of troublemakers from around the country. The property will be located in Capitol Hill, close to the White House and the Capitol building, and will enable activists to quickly mobilize against Trump should he court controversy during his presidency.

Ultimately its to make sure we hold him accountable, said Moumita Ahmed, the founder of Millennials for Revolution, a group which span off from the Bernie Sanders-supporting Millennials for Bernie.

Because his presidency is not normal at all. Its our duty to make sure he doesnt succeed.

If he succeeds its a message that everything he stood for is OK. That its OK to get to power in the way that he did, and hurt all the people hes hurt.

District 13 will be open to activist groups around the country who wish to demonstrate in the capital, Ahmed said. The house is inspired by movement houses from the civil rights era, which served as a safe haven for people to plan marches and protests.

People from ethnic-minority activist groups, such as African Americans for Bernie and Color of Change, are involved in planning for the movement house, while climate change and minimum wage campaigners have also contributed.

Most of the people involved are people who will most definitely be affected by this administration, Ahmed said.

As someone who is from a Muslim family, Im invested in the safety of my community. And I see this administration as a threat to my community, especially because of the rhetoric that was used to become the president.

The groups launched a crowdfunding effort on Tuesday to support District 13. They aim to reach $50,000, which will cover the houses rent for one year.

Erika Peralta, who has worked for Color of Change  an organization with more than one million members that works to create a more human and less hostile world for black people in America  is another organizer of District 13. She plans to live in the house for the first three months of Trumps presidency.

The aim is to be a focal point and a nexus for activists and progressive people across the country to provide them resources and aid and our networks to stop any hatred that may come from the White House or to stand up against it, Peralta said.

Were going to work to make sure that whatever [Trump] is trying to do, whether its a Muslim registry or deport a bunch of immigrants, were not going to let that happen.",2

The Cong were after me, Trump said, visibly stirred by the memory. And then, just in the nick of time, I got my deferment.

The former reality-show star said he had never shared his record as a war hero before because I dont like to boast.

He said that he only disclosed the episode now because the way this nation treats our deferment veterans is a disgrace.

Trump complained that he received no official commendation or medal for his heroism, calling the lack of recognition shameful.

Our adversarial relationships with Cuba and Iran took years of frostiness and saber-rattling to maintain, Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of the Washington-based Institute for Infinite Conflict, said. Thanks to the President, decades of well-crafted hostility have been thrown out the window.

According to Dorrinson, fears abound in conservative circles that the President might be capriciously casting about for other powder kegs to defuse during his remaining time in office.

If his shameful record is any guide, hell probably try to disarm North Korea, Dorrinson said. Thats the doomsday scenario.

Regardless of his future actions, Obamas detente with Cuba and Iran will likely tarnish his legacy forever, Dorrinson said. On this Presidents watch, America lost two of its most enduring foes, he said. Hes going to have to live with that for the rest of his life.",3

Donald Trump has grabbed a lot of headlines over the past few weeks by spewing bigotry and venom, Walker told an enthusiastic crowd of supporters. I want to make it clear that when it comes to those things, I take a back seat to no one.

Concluding his speech with a line that triggered a standing ovation, Walker said, To those who thought Donald Trump was the only sociopath in the race, let me say this: not anymore.

Prior to his announcement, aides to the Wisconsin governor had privately fretted that by establishing his identity as an arrogant and ill-informed merchant of hatred, Trump had appropriated Walkers brand.

In the hopes of proving that Trump has no monopoly on odiousness, aides have released a point-by-point comparison showing that on such key issues as workers rights and health care, Walker is just as terrifying as the former reality-show host.

Acknowledging that Trump has dominated media attention for now, Walkers aides believe that the governor will eventually reclaim his rightful mantle as the worst person in the race.

Sooner or later, the Trump candidacy is going to fall apart and voters are going to be looking for another dick to vote for, one aide said. Scott Walker wants to be that dick.",3

I think we need to remember that as a result of our first-past-the-post system, only 39.5% of people voted for us, explained Trudeau in an interview with Le Devoir. This simply isnt a sufficient mandate to reform the system that produced this outcome.

Now I did say that the 2015 federal election would be the last election that uses first-past-the-post, but I was expecting at least half or two-thirds of Canadians to vote for me and my party.

Trudeau also noted that many of his MPs didnt receive a majority of votes in their riding as a justification for backing away from his promise.

Just look at Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef. She only won her riding by less that 44% of the vote! How can a Minister have the legitimacy of leading the change of our electoral system when 56% of her constituents voted against her?

This is a simple misunderstanding, one that Im sure happens to many Canadians, explained Eaton told the press while attending a fundraiser gala for slightly less wealthy children. I dont recall ever being told I was an Officer of Parliament. I know this Harper fellow vaguely, and I thought I was signing up for one of those European cruises on Parliament Hill. I really leave that appointment business to my accountants and lawyers.

On the one hand, yes, these children are under-equipped to handle the basic calculations they may encounter outside of school as well as the more difficult problems theyll see in higher grades, said Education Minister Mitzie Hunter. But on the other hand, they are more than equipped to not understand what it means for Ontario to owe 300 billion dollars, and thus be the worlds most indebted sub-sovereign borrower.

Plus, there is absolutely no way they could understand how abysmal our deficit spending plan is.

Luckily, the Premier said, they did not.

"160","201.txt","Obama Finally Fulfills Campaign Promise To Spend One Night In Abandoned Amusement Park","CEDAR PLAINS, PAAfter years of delays and mounting criticism from voters and political pundits, President Barack Obama finally followed through on a campaign promise he made in 2008 to spend one night alone in the abandoned Cedar Plains Family Fun amusement park, sources confirmed Wednesday.

At approximately 6 p.m. last night, members of the press reportedly looked on as Obamacarrying only a flashlight, a water bottle, and a backpack full of snacksscaled the 9-foot-high chain-link fence and entered the derelict theme park, making good on a vow that had been a central component of his initial run for the White House.

Eight years ago, I made an oath that if I were elected president, I would spend dusk till dawn in this old, run-down amusement park, and tonight I am fulfilling my obligation to the American people, said Obama, who had been widely accused of favoring other legislative priorities above an overnight stay inside the dilapidated regional attraction that shut its doors in 2003. Between now and sunrise, I will climb to the top of the Ripsaw roller coaster, I will throw a rock through the window of the snow cone stand, and just as Ive said time and time again, I will wander around in the big concrete track where the Lazy River used to be.

And to prove that I do not take your support for granted, I will also walk through the Hall of Mirrors at midnight, Obama added.

Since first raising the issue during the 2008 primaries, Obamas promise to spend at least 12 hours unaccompanied within the overgrown park grounds has been a focal point of his domestic policy. Throughout the general election, his repeated vows to climb down into the basin under the Gophers Gulch log flume and spend 10 minutes inside one of the rusted cars on the Ferris wheel became fixtures of his stump speeches and TV ads, characterizing the young Illinois senator as the only candidate willing to brave the eerily barren park in the dead of night.

However, with the pledge still unfulfilled after Obamas first 100 days in office, activists began protesting outside the White House regularly, demanding to know when the president would finally put on a thick coat, walk across the propertys cracked parking lot to the padlocked gates, and implement his much-discussed plan to stroll down Cedar Plains debris-strewn midway under the light of a full moon.

At a time of great strife when Americans were looking for something to rally around, Obama united the country by swearing that one of his top goals would be to crawl under the wooden barricades and investigate the parks old food court, said political analyst Mark Halperin, noting that Obama built momentum around his candidacy and attracted sizable political donations whenever he mentioned the possibility of finding old funnel cake and cotton candy machines that had gone unused for years. So perhaps it was inevitable that there would be backlash when Obamas first two years elapsed without him providing even a basic outline of how he would break into the amusement park or a list of which of the decrepit rides he would see if he could turn back on.

Frankly, he got lucky when the bin Laden raid took everyones attention away, or else he may not have been reelected, Halperin added.

In an effort to help secure his presidential legacy, Obama returned to his campaign pledge earlier this year, announcing to the nation during his State of the Union address that he had purchased a sleeping bag in anticipation of spending a night in the park, and later telling graduates in a speech at Howard University that before he left office, he would do everything in his power to take a picture from inside the Gravitron to show people what it looked like in there now.

I was really impressed with Obama when he was first running because he seemed like the only candidate who actually had the will and the temperament to spend the whole night in a spooky boarded-up amusement park, said Kansas City, MO resident Angie Hartney, noting that the then-senators claim was one of the primary reasons she supported him in 2008. I still think he shouldve done this back in his first term, but after all the compromises and excusesand it seeming like hed never actually go down into the underground storage rooms where they supposedly keep some of the old bumper carsits great to know he still has the power to inspire people.

Thats the Obama I voted for, added Hartney.

At press time, the presidents approval rating had risen to an all-time high as an exhausted but triumphant Obama emerged from the park holding a tattered stuffed animal from the shuttered ring toss stand.",3

Kennedy said that California prisons were designed to house a population of 80,000 but that the population was close to double that. Prisoners he said, are crammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to house inmates... [S]uicidal inmates may be held for prolonged periods in telephone booth sized cages without toilets  and the lack of care results in needless suffering and death. Stating the often overlooked but obvious truism, Justice Kennedy says that even though incarcerated, Prisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all persons. Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. He concludes his opinion saying that The medical and mental health care provided by Californias prisons falls below the standard of decency that inheres in the Eighth Amendment.

Overcrowding is a problem in federal prisons as well. According to The Crime Report, when the U.S. Attorney for Atlanta, Sally Quillian Yates, was testifying before the U.S. Sentencing Commission in Washington in late May 2010, she said that federal facilities are currently operating at 34 percent above capacity. In her testimony she said that the overcrowding will have real and detrimental consequences for the safety of prisoners. Her concerns are echoed by Bryan Lowry, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals. Testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee in 2010 he pointed out to the committee that between June 2008 and the time of his testimony in March 2010, there were 340 inmate-on-staff assaults in federal prisons nationwide. He told the committee that These aggressive acts by inmates against staff illustrate a common reality facing staff daily at their workplace. Federal prisons have continued to be increasingly dangerous places to work, primarily because of serious correctional worker understaffing and prison inmate overcrowding problems. And that all serves to highlight what we learned from the Platt case. Overcrowding violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment that is proscribed by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It also helps explain the death of Anwar al-Awlaki, the United States citizen who was summarily executed by the United States Government because he had been designated a terrorist.

Mr. Awlaki was killed September 30 in Yemen by a missile fired from a United States operated drone aircraft. Mr. Awlaki spent the first seven years of his life in Las Cruces New Mexico. His family moved to Yemen where he lived until he was 19 when he returned to the United States to attend college. Following his graduation he became an Imam at assorted mosques in the United States. Eventually he became a fiery preacher advocating the mass murder of American citizens.

In early 2010 the U.S. government said his actions made him a justifiable target for capture or death. His father objected to the fact that his son had been made death penalty eligible without having been tried or convicted of any offense. Aided by the ACLU he went to court alleging that the actions of the government in authorizing his sons summary execution violated the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. The judge threw out the lawsuit although he said that the actions of the government raised stark, and perplexing, questions one of which was whether the president could order the assassination of a U.S. citizen without first affording him any form of judicial process whatsoever, based [on] the mere assertion that he is a dangerous member of a terrorist organization. The question has now been answered. It can, it did and Mr. Awlaki is now dead.

In making its decision to kill Mr. Awlaki, it is clear that the Obama administration was addressing two competing interests. If Mr. Awlaki was captured and sent to prison his 5th Amendment due process rights would be preserved but the other prisoners 8th Amendment rights would be impinged by increasing the overcrowding. By killing him the administration was violating the constitutional rights of only one person instead of many. Examined in that light it is obvious that the government made the right decision. It should also cause the rest of the country to wonder how far the administration is willing to go to avoid further prison overcrowding. Time will tell.",3
"166","2015.txt","Republican Debates Cancelled; Candidates to Wrestle Bears Instead","In an unusual move, the remaining scheduled Republican debates will be replaced by a series of wrestling matches that pit the competing presidential candidates against a variety of large bears. The American people are sick and tired of talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, said Evan Reutmaster, the Republican National Committee Press Director/Bear Wrangler. They want action and its clear that the candidates who can successfully wrestle and defeat a bear are ready to wrestle the economy, foreign policy, and Barack Obama.

In tonights debate, televised live on CNN and Animal Planet, the eight Republican candidates will choose between Greco-Roman and freestyle human-bear wrestling; a lottery has already determined the ursine opponents, from a field including Grizzlies, Giant Pandas, and Asiatic Black Bears. Should the winner of each match actually be a bear, that bear will then be eligible to enter the Iowa Caucuses in February 2012, following appropriate periods of hibernation.

Washington insiders are unsure of what strategies the Republican candidates will bring to these matches, given their limited experience in bear wrestling. Aside from Rick Perry shooting a coyote, this really levels the playing field, says Republican strategist Pete Hallmeck. I have wrestled the bears of tax burdens and out-of-control government, Michele Bachmann told reporters earlier today. A real bear should not be a problem, whether its a Kodiak or a koala. When it was pointed out that a koala is not actually a real bear, Bachmann asked, What about Yogi Bear?

In a related story, Sarah Palin released a statement saying she definitely might not maybe not not seek the Oval Office and noted, I dont need to run for president to wrestle bears.",3
"167","2016.txt","Obama Could Seek Advice From Kerry, Gore About How to Lose to Unqualified Texan","Tired and frustrated after spending so much time dealing with a bitterly divided Congress that needlessly created self-inflicted wounds to the U.S. economy, President Obama has begun to privately weigh the personal benefits of losing the 2012 presidential election. However, as the Republican field takes form, he is increasingly concerned that the number of weak candidates could force him to remain in the nations worst job whether he wants to or not.

One of the more difficult challenges for Obama would be losing to Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is currently considered co-frontrunner for the nomination. With a slew of controversial remarks  including statements about the unconstitutionality of Medicare and Social Security, as well as a proposal for seceding his state from the country he seeks to lead  a Perry nomination would all but guarantee that the President will be stuck dealing with the 534 most difficult people in America for another four years.

Realizing that even with a dismal sub-forty-percent approval rating, he is still favored to win re-election, President Obama has decided to consult Senator John Kerry and former Vice President Al Gore, the two men who know more than anyone else about losing presidential elections to unqualified Texas governors.

Its all about doing everything you can to show the American people you know nothing about what theyre dealing with, says former president-elect Al Gore. If the President talks about jobs while his opponents talk about tax cuts, that will make him look sensible. He needs to start talking more about why his opponents are weirdos or crazy people if he is seriously considering losing this thing.

I think his problem is hes too consistent, said Mr. Kerry. As an example, Kerry cited the presidents Afghanistan policy. He is doing exactly what he said he would do when he ran for president: focusing more troops fighting al Qaeda in the place they actually attacked us from. Its ridiculous to do the same thing you said you would four years ago if you want to lose that job. Instead he should bow to his critics on the left and withdraw immediately.

Not really looking like you want the job and failing to communicate why your opponent is dangerously incompetent are also tried-and-true techniques, added Gore. Hes off to a good start there, no question.

To keep his options open if he decides he wants another term but ends up competing against the most threatening of the GOP contenders, President Obama has begun consulting members of Bushs 2004 re-election campaign as well. When a reporter asked one of the courted staffers why the Obama campaign was interested, he replied he and his team have extensive experience working for an incumbent with terrible approval ratings while campaigning against a flip-flopper from Massachusetts.",3
"168","2017.txt","Announcing the Arnold Palmer Party  A Delightfully Refreshing Political Alternative","Like growing numbers of Americans, I am disgusted by what presidential historian Douglas Brinkley has accurately but politely described as the hyper-partisanship of todays political discourse.

We are a house badly divided. Worse yet, were like a family where the family members cant even have a civil dinner table conversation. Actually, we cant even keep the lasagna on our plate without flinging a forkful across the table.

The Debt Ceiling Debacle is the latest stop  perhaps the end of the line  on the train to nowhere that the American political conversation has become. Its like the Democrats and Republicans are drag racing down Constitution Avenue, making obscene gestures at each other, hurtling unbeknownst (or, worse yet, knowingly) towards certain death. Only, oh yeah, were in the backseat.

Then there is just the sheer exhaustion of daily exposure to strident, mean-spirited and jabbering politicians who have misplaced their prescriptions for chill pills. I mean, really, a roiling, broiling over-heated non-debate is absolutely the last thing we need in a summer marked with sustained record-breaking temperatures. Its saying a lot when, this July, more Americans will succumb to political exhaustion than to heat stroke.

Its all so enervating. As Huff Post blogger and Columbia University professor Trey Ellis keenly observed a few days back, Cubs fans are less depressed than fans of a brighter American future. 

Taxation without Representation  or Sanity

The problem with this political shrilly season  besides the fact that it is bringing us to the brink of financial ruin  is that almost no ones point of view is being represented. This is worse than Taxation without Representation; this is Taxation without Sanity.

Whos to blame for this sorry and troubling state of affairs? Some point their fingers to the Tea Partys cold and calculated hijacking of the Republican agenda. Others blame the Pelosi-Reid Cabal (which, I was surprised recently to learn, is not an indie rock group). All I know is that 200 million or so Americans are left with no voice in whats supposed to be a representative system of government.

Well, just like Howard Beale, anchor of the fictional UBS Evening News from Network, who 35 years ago brought the nation together in frustration, I am also opening up my window to the world and shouting, Im mad as hell, and Im not going to take this anymore!

It is time for America to reestablish and reclaim the middle ground with a third party that we can all get behind. Thats why, today, I am announcing the formation of the Arnold Palmer Party (APP). Our singular goal: to refresh the American political discourse.

Get Down with APP

Our party takes its name from the popular summertime refresher  the Arnold Palmer  a delightful, hard-to-resist combination of iced tea and lemonade named after that famous middle-of-the- fairway golfer (and all-around decent human being), Arnold Palmer.

I mean, really, if iced tea and lemonade  once thought an unlikely and unappetizing combination  can get along...

And consider this important point: the Arnold Palmer Party is steeped  literally and figuratively  in tradition. The Tea Party may invoke the famous goings-on in Boston Harbor 238 years ago; hell, we drink from that cup. Further, the Arnold Palmer Party is founded on that fundamental expression of American optimism and resolve: When life gives you lemons, make lemonade (and then mix it in equal parts with some fresh-brewed iced tea).

Look, the Tea Party is not without its redeeming qualities. Its hard to argue that we can blithely ignore an ever-expanding Federal government and personal responsibility is almost always a good thing. On the other hand, how much money do really rich people really need and what about the lemonade values of shared responsibility, cooperation, equality and empowerment? Which brings us to the Arnold Palmer Party.

Our party is all about solutions and reinvigoration, about ensuring that the interests of those of us who are not two standard deviations away from the middle remain front and center in the public debate on issues of consequence, and about fostering (indeed, insisting on) a constructive, respectful and unhysterical political conversation. We are founded on these five simple tenets:

	We reward collaboration and compromise, not conflict and conflagration;
	We believe in possibility and creative problem-solving;
	We only support political candidates who are civil, cooperative and well hydrated;
	We sign scorecards, not pledges;
	We believe in fair play.

Lets reclaim the political conversation. We can do this, America. Like Arnold Palmer (the golfer) once said: The most rewarding things you do in life are often the ones that look like they cannot be done. Like everybody coming together to form an even more perfect Union, maybe?

Its time for a new Arnies Army to assemble and walk the fairways of American political discourse. The Arnold Palmer Party. Join us. Because, after all, whats a party without a beverage?",3
"169","2018.txt","Obama: Romney Put Profits Ahead of Losses","Escalating his attack on Mitt Romney and Bain Capital, President Obama charged yesterday that Romney and Bain put profits ahead of losses.

Obama released two Bain Private Placement Memoranda (PPMs) prepared for investors during Romneys tenure. Obama found the documents disturbing and mean-spirited.

They reveal that Romney and Bain employed the lure of profits to entice investors, Obama claimed. Their sole promise to investors was a good return on investment. In their pitch to investors, Bain completely ignored combating global warming, fighting childhood obesity, and helping homeowners with underwater mortgages.

Even worse, Bain and Romney accepted only those investors willing to pay Bains asking price. Ability to pay was Bains sole criterion for accepting investors. Bain made no attempt to achieve ethnic, racial, gender, or sexual preference balance among their investors, Obama continued.

Bain was in business to make money, Obama declared. Their PPMs prove it. Bain and Romney were blinded by greed. Had they been willing to incur large losses, they could addressed issues that most concern hard-working middle class Americans, such as helping hard-working middle class Americans struggling to pay texting overcharges for their hard-working middle class children.

Obama contrasted his experience as a community organizer with Romneys concern about profits. I was trying to improve the lives of everyone in the community. The only time I focused on money was when our grants needed renewal.

Obama said working for a profit making organization is poor training for a president. The presidents job is to finance deficits, not to maximize profits. Moreover, its the presidents job to assure that everybody in the country has a fair shot by providing government programs that dont work.

Applying the private sectors heartless logic of cost/benefit would decimate government programs, Obama stated. For example, federal job training programs would appear absurdly inefficient until you consider how virtuous these programs make us feel about our good intentions.",3

(SatireWire.com)  Pushed to the limits of pain by an election that was initially entertaining but has clearly gotten out of hand, Americans today are frantically trying to remember the safe word that will stop this sadistic presidential race before it ends badly.

Honestly, at first I thought it was just a little role-playing, said Jessica Riley, 44, of Austin, Texas. Donald Trump as President Trump? I was like, It feels so wrong, but I cant turn away. But then the FBI jumped into the race with more emails and suddenly I was like,  Oh God no, Donald Trump actually is going to be president! Apple! Baseball! Putin!


Honestly, I cant think of what it was! added desperate 28-year-old Clay Toombs of Charlotte, N.C. Pineapple? Oklahoma? Mussolini? Just please stop! And no I am not kidding, and no I am not saying this because I really want you to keep going! I mean it!

With the election only days away, voters said they probably should have ended this dark, 50 Shades of Orange fantasy sooner, but conceded they didnt recognize how abusive things would become.

OK, intially it did spice things up, said Seattle resident Taylor Bryant, 38. Trump was really pushing the boundaries. He was into all the kinky stuff like gagging the press, handcuffing immigrants, stop and frisk. Plus he had this whole prison fantasy with Hillary. But then he got over-the-top dirty  pussy grabbing, blood coming out of her wherever, and, cmon, suggesting hed like to get it on with his daughter?

I draw the line at scarring, Bryant added. I dont want any visible scars, and right now I feel scarred for life.

Due to the incomprehensible votes cast by certain members of this household electorate, I am shifting policy to address the very real threat that my husband Scott is an idiot, said Deirdre Taylor of Richmond, Va. As a result, I am today redistricting our house such that Scott resides only his areas, specifically the basement, the garage, the couch  every night  and the yard, although not in areas of the yard where I can see him or hear him or smell him.

The bedroom, she added, is now the equivalent of the post-industrial Midwestern states that went for Trump.

Its a place of anger and sadness that was once a thriving hub of activity but now thats gone and its never coming back, she said.

The Taylors, who have been married for 12 years, are among thousands of couples in the U.S. that are struggling to adapt to the seismic shift in their once-united states, a shift brought on by a vote in which the women voted for Hillary Clinton and the men chose Trump.

Ironically, many of these white, suburban males now find themselves holding the status of the women and minorities Trump often railed against.

Ive talked it over with Deirdre and our friends, and my husband Kirk and his buddies will now be marginalized, under-served and, politically and in all other ways, impotent, said Kora Ann Snelling, a neighbor of Deirdres. Using terms Mr. Trump and my husband can understand, theyll be vaginally bankrupt.

For the Taylors, the shift became apparent late on election night as they watched the results come in.

I asked Scott if he voted for Hillary, and he said, Um Deirdre recalled.

Thats all I said! Um, Scott explained.

Because you couldnt bring yourself to admit you voted for a race-baiting, misogynistic pathological liar who draws support from white nationalists and boasts of sexual assault! Deirdre countered.

But I just wanted to make American great again, Scott protested.

Why dont you make the doghouse great again instead? Deirdre replied.

We dont have a dog, Scott pointed out.

Well get Mexico to build you one! she said.

While Trump doesnt take office until January, Deirdre has already taken steps to institute a core tenet of her new policy.

I have completed a virtual border wall between myself and the father of our children  our two daughters!  and if he so much as attempts to approach he will be treated as an enemy combatant, she said.

At press time, Deirdre was reading the children a book about tolerance while Scott was trapped in a hell of his own making.",3

The crowd at a South Carolina rally initially fell silent, but quickly found its voice after realizing the candidate had, in that moment, managed to sum up his gritty campaign.

Wow, that was like everything hes ever said put into solid form! gushed 24-year-old Ty Leveren of Aiken, S.C.

He just did what were all thinking! added 55-year-old Randy Loafen of Columbia.


Trumps seemingly spontaneous evacuation came at the end of a particularly inflammatory 30-minute speech that simultaneously wound up his followers and unwound his bowels.

Doesnt that make you angry? he went on. Doesnt that make you furious? In fact, doesnt everything I say just make you want to to hold on. Ill show you!


Trump then lowered his suit pants to his ankles, leaned over his podium, and defecated.


Sensing unease in the silence that followed, the candidate quickly took control, strutting around the stage and nodding at his handiwork.


First of all, I have to say, wow, thats a great crap, Trump said. Maybe the best crap ever? People will say that. Because I crap like nobodys business, thats how good I am at crapping. Im full up to here with it. Doctors  the best specialists  have told me that. They say, Donald, youre so amazing. Youre so full of crap. So yeah, great, great crap.


But that steaming pile on the floor is more than that, folks, he continued. That incredible, steaming pile of billionaire gold is my message. Thats what I say about Islam! Thats what I say about liberal America! Thats what I say about Time magazine! That, folks, is what I have said, and will continue to say, right up to the day Im sworn in as your next president!


The crowd then burst into cheers, replacing its usual chant of Trump! Trump! Trump! with shouts of, Dump! Dump! Dump! But the business mogul demurred.


Folks folks folks, please, I cant, he intoned. Ive got to save some. Ive got other rallies today. But trust me, when I leave here, Im going to shit on Iowa, Im going to shit on New Hampshire, and when Im elected, Im going to shit on the whole country!


After the rally, Trump followers were ecstatic.


Trump is the real deal, said Cheryl Cramhoster of Mt. Pleasant, S.C. You know where he stands, and now we even know what he had for breakfast!


Karen Everton, 66, who drove to the rally from North Carolina, said the crude delivery of Trumps message would not dampen her enthusiasm for his presidential bid.


I dont know why he did it, but it makes me love him even more, she said. Its like, Donald Trump doesnt just say shit, he does shit. He literally does shit.",3

At EU headquarters in Brussels, ministers are shouting so loudly in their heads you can hear it.
Putin only understands force, and we therefore have no choice but to respond with force, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry thought moments before meeting with Sergei Lavrov, Russias Foreign Minister. Lavrov, you have 24 hours to get your troops out of Crimea or its war, Kerry said to himself in the mirror before going out and saying nothing of the kind.

As you can well imagine, I did not want to be in charge of something that the Bible does not condone, he said. But then I realized that perhaps the Lord wants me to take this job so that I can banish housing and urban development from the earth.

Carson offered no details about how he would eliminate housing, but said that he was seeking advice from Trumps pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. Shes basically trying to do the same thing with education, he said.

The retired neurosurgeon said that he was looking forward to taking the reins at hud but that he had a lot of loose ends to tie up before then. Right now, I need to find my shoes, he said.",3

According to the aides, Obama said that, while he understood that Trump was eager to create potentially cataclysmic diplomatic crises around the world, tradition dictated that he wait until he is actually President to do so.

Obama cited the example of George W. Bush, who waited until he took the oath of office before wreaking destruction on a massive scale.

Therell be loads of time for you to do stuff like that, Obama reportedly said.

During the meeting, which lasted nearly an hour, Obama repeatedly asked Trump if he understood what was being said to him, the aides reported.

After the meeting, Trump spoke briefly with reporters but cut the session short to jump on a phone call with Kim Jong-un.

Hes a terrific guy, hes doing just a terrific job over there, Trump said, of the North Korean leader.

Obama did not take questions from reporters but was later seen sitting at his desk, holding his head in his hands.",3

The incident, which rocked political circles in Trenton and Washington, happened in full view of the midtown-Manhattan crowds outside of Trump Tower, where the vandalized limo had been parked.

Suddenly, this guy broke through security, whipped out his keys, and made a gigantic gash along the side of the limo, said Harland Dorrinson, a tourist from Missouri who witnessed the incident. Police started wrestling him to the ground, and I was, like, Holy crap, thats Chris Christie. 

Fellow-Republicans reacted to Christies arrest with sadness and sympathy. This whole transition period has been tough on a lot of folks, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney said.

Across New Jersey, residents like Carol Foyler, of Teaneck, said that they were shocked by their governors spectacular fall. I never would have guessed that this would be the thing hed go to jail for, she said.",3

In an official statement, Trump said that El Chapos tremendous success in the private sector showed that he has what it takes to shake things up at the D.E.A.

Trumps appointment of the former drug lord surprised many in Washington, in no small part because acrimony between the two allegedly prompted El Chapo, in 2015, to put a hundred-million-dollar bounty on Trumps head.

But, appearing on CNN, the Trump surrogate Kellyanne Conway said that the selection of El Chapo should surprise no one. Mr. Trump always said that he would surround himself with the best people, she said.

When asked why Trump had readily offered a job to El Chapo while still mulling the fate of another former adversary, Mitt Romney, Conway said, El Chapo might not have voted for Mr. Trump, but thats because hes Mexican and in jail, and Mitt Romney is neither.

I Googled it, and, I must say, I was surprised, he said. There was a lot in it that really made sense, to be honest.

He said that he regretted that the frenetic pace of the presidential campaign had prevented him from Googling Obamacare earlier. Youre always running, running, running, he said. There were so many times that I made a mental note to Google Obamacare but I just never got around to it.

Trump also told the reporters that, now that the campaign was over, he had finally found the time to Google Mexico.

Really eye-opening, he said. A lot of the Mexicans are terrific. They do just terrific things.

When asked if Googling Mexico had affected his position on building a wall, Trump said, Quite frankly, it did make me wonder a bit about that. A lot of these terrific Mexicans could come in and make a real contribution to our country and, in exchange, I think theyd really benefit from Obamacare.

These two guys are completely unskilled, unemployable, and angry, Trump said, as the two males glowered at the press corps. I, and I alone, can create jobs for people like them.

Gesturing vehemently at the two men, Trump underlined his last point. No oneI repeat, no onebut me is willing to give these two jobs, he said.

The two unskilled men profusely thanked Trump, and said that they had almost given up hope that anyone would ever hire them again.

Appearing on CNN, another unskilled white male, Corey Lewandowski, said that the two jobs Trump had created were just the beginning.

According to Clinton-campaign sources, the new slogan is designed to appeal to suburban women, a group of voters that has historically opposed blowing up the planet.

Clinton launched the slogan at a campaign appearance in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she told supporters, On Day One of my Administration, I will work for you. I will fight for you. And I will not blow up the planet.

But, even as Clinton spoke, the slogan came under fire from Donald Trumps campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who said that it reflected the failed policies of the past.

Putin will be the most visible Trump surrogate in the final weekend of the campaign, as he tries to fire up voters in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, and Nevada.

The Russian President seemed to relish the warm response he got at his first Trump rally, in Tampa, where he led the crowd in a raucous chant of Lock her up.

Trump praised Putins talent for politics by noting that he had won the Russian election in 2012 by a landslide. He got sixty-four per cent of the vote, and no one else even came close, Trump said. Hes terrific.

Putin, whose English is rudimentary at best, kept his remarks brief at the Tampa rally, but echoed Melania Trumps recent call for an end to bullying.

A Republican strategist, Harland Dorrinson, called the Trump campaigns use of Putin in crucial battleground states very, very smart.

At this point, you really couldnt ask for a more effective surrogate, he said. Youd much rather see Trump up there with Putin than with, say, Chris Christie.

While some in the media criticized the Trump campaign for allowing Putin to influence the outcome of a U.S. election, the Republican nominees campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, pushed back in an appearance on CNN.

This is just another case of media bias against Donald Trump, she said. Jay Z and Beyoncé, who have no experience in government at all, are allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton, but Vladimir Putin, who actually runs an entire country, cant appear with Donald Trump? Come on.",3

The mug, which portrays an angry man shouting a racist phrase, immediately drew the ire of Democrats, who said it sends exactly the wrong signal to a divided nation.

But Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway brushed off the criticism.

Democrats talk about healing our country, and yet this kind of talk does nothing to bring our country together, said Conway. President-elect Trump is very pleased to have the angry, racist coffee mug join his incredible team to make America great again, and I urge all Americans not to judge the angry, racist coffee mug on its past performance, on what we think its views are, or on any other forms of perceiving it, but instead judge it on what it will do in the unknowable future.

Other Republicans accused Democrats of attempting to undermine the incoming president.

They lost the election and now theyre pointing fingers trying to make the angry, racist coffee mug into a caricature, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. I havent met the angry, racist coffee mug personally, so I cant say its racist or not, but I can say its ridiculous to claim that the angry, racist coffee mug is entirely responsible for every single thing thats printed on it.

Tremendous magazine, Playboy. The best magazine. Its got beautiful women in it. I love beautiful women, President-elect Trump told reporter Leslie Stahl in the interview.

"187","261.txt","ExxonMobil CEO Relieved It Finally Too Late To Do Anything About Climate Change","Tillerson says things could have gone really bad for him if people had followed through on their vows to stop climate change.
IRVING, TXSaying the multinational oil and gas conglomerate had really dodged a bullet, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson told reporters Wednesday how relieved he was now that it was finally too late to do anything about climate change.

The 64-year-old petroleum executive, who acknowledged that throughout his career he had feared the public might take action to curb rising temperatures by imposing emissions restrictions or mandating a switch to alternative energy, said he was just happy that the window for avoiding the planets environmental destruction had closed, and that the entire industry was now free to carry on as usual.

I was really worried for a while there that some kind of law would be passed to stop us from releasing all those hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, but I guess not, said Tillerson, describing how he felt as if a tremendous weight had been lifted from his shoulders now that catastrophic climate change was an inescapable certainty. Seriously, its a huge load off. There were a number of real tense years after the recycling movement picked up momentum when we thought people might all turn away from fossil fuels next. But its just so reassuring to know that we passed the point where its no longer possible to stop global warming through environmental regulation or green energy or anything like that.

Now I can finally just relax, he continued. This really makes things so much easier.

The CEO remarked that, back when it was still possible to halt the devastating effects of climate change, he constantly feared that the energy industry would be forced to make costly concessions toward sustainability, perhaps investing in expensive technology that would reduce oil and gas companies environmental impact, and thereby severely harm his corporations bottom line.

Tillerson told reporters that growing public interest in wind and solar energy gave him a pretty good scare for a while, but noted how he eventually came to realize the publics engagement was largely limited to vocalizing support for the initiatives rather than taking any substantive action to move the overall energy sector in those directions. He also admitted to losing sleep in 2009 when Congress considered regulating carbon emissions with a cap-and-trade system, although he said he now felt silly for ever believing that might actually happen.

While he became less worried about the possibility of government regulation after seeing the rapid melting of polar ice caps go completely unchecked, Tillerson stated that he was careful not to get his hopes up too high until humanity had blown through every last milestone for averting the worst effects of global warming, including atmospheric carbon dioxide surpassing 400 parts per million and average worldwide temperatures exceeding 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels.

After scientists started saying we were in the middle of a global mass extinction event and still nobody at any level did anything to try to stop itthats when I knew we were in the clear, said Tillerson, remarking that, by that point, he had become certain everyone would just keep driving their gas-powered vehicles and running their air conditioners 24 hours a day no matter what. Theres just no way people are going to start switching over to renewables at this point. Hell, even if the whole world demanded new fuel-efficiency standards today, theyd be completely useless now that were beyond the point of no return, so really, why even bother?

And thank goodness, he added. Everyones complete hopelessness about the whole situation really is the best thing that could have happened to us.",3

As millions of Americans actively count down the days until Giuliani disappears forever, thirteen more days of him seems like a lifetime, Davis Logsdon, a psychologist who has been studying the Giuliani ordeal, said.

Americans traumatic experience of Rudy Giuliani in 2016 has gone through several phases, Logsdon said. First, they struggled to remember who he was. Then, once they remembered, they recoiled in horror. Finally, they began actively wishing he would go away forever. That is the phase many people find themselves in today.

Even as they long for the day when Giuliani resumes his rightful place in obscurity, many Americans are experiencing feelings of anger and disbelief that he was permitted to crawl back into their consciousness to begin with, Logsdon said.
Of the many inexcusable things that cable news has done this election, repeatedly subjecting Americans to Rudy Giuliani is at the top of the list, he said. The human cost has been enormous.

As they struggle to endure the final thirteen days of Rudy Giuliani, Americans should not feel isolated or alone, Logsdon said. They need to know that there are millions of people just like them, and even more who are unsure if they can stand another thirteen days of Kellyanne Conway, he said.",3

Bo, get out of the way! said Sunny, her teeth bared and her fur bristling as she lunged toward the menacing cougar, ultimately scaring it back into the forest. Thats right! Run away, you coward! Nobodys going to hurt my friend while Im around!

Dont worry, Bo, she added. Youre safe now.

Administration officials said the two Portuguese water dogs were mistakenly left in Yellowstone by the vacationing Obamas, who returned home believing Sunny and Bo had been loaded aboard Air Force One, never realizing the pair had scampered off the tarmac and into the woods moments before takeoff to chase a squirrel. It is believed that the dogs later returned to the spot where they had last scented Barack, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha Obama and, after sitting patiently overnight until realizing the family was not going to return, decided to find their way back to Washington, D.C. on their own, beginning a 2,000-mile journey eastward.

The first pets reportedly spent the next few days bounding over mountain passes and wading through rocky streams, from which Bo would, after several fruitless attempts, emerge with a fish in his mouth, providing much-needed sustenance to the pair, who were accustomed to being fed nutritious meals at regular intervals by their White House handlers. Early on in their trek, Sunny and Bo are said to have encountered several hikers they thought might rescue them. However, the group turned out to be German tourists who, reportedly failing to recognize the presidential seal on the dogs collars, simply pet them, fed them some dried fruit, and continued on their way.

What do you think theyre eating at the state dinner tonight? Bo asked a tired, disinterested Sunny as the two crouched inside a hollow tree trunk where they had been forced to take shelter during a particularly fierce storm. I bet theyre having steak. Oh, man, I can almost taste it now. Thats my absolute favorite. Do you think Malia is saving her leftovers for me? I bet she is.

I miss Washington, Bo continued. Well be back home soon, though, right?

According to sources, rarely a day of their adventure went by without the two dogs getting into a precarious situation that required them to rely on each other to get through. At one point, after traveling for a day without water, Sunny reportedly came upon a rushing river and, in her eagerness to take a drink, slipped on a rock, fell in, and was swept away by the powerful current. Bo is believed to have reached the rivers edge just in time to see Sunnys head pop up and disappear around the bend. With neither dog having much swimming experience outside the White House pool, sources said a quick-thinking Bo ran downstream as fast as he could, grabbed one end of a long stick in his jaws, extended it out over the water, had Sunny bite down on the other end, and managed to pull her to safety just before she would have plunged over a waterfall.

Several weeks later, sources reported that a curious Bo followed an unusual scent into a hollow log lying on its side in the Black Hills, only to come scrambling out moments later pursued by a slowly ambling porcupine. Bo is said to have spent the rest of the evening whimpering as Sunny carefully removed the quills stuck in her companions muzzle using her teeth, at one point pausing to say, You have to go and stick your nose in everything, dont you?

Cold and hungry as they crossed through barren, wintry terrain, the first dogs were reportedly found trudging through chest-deep snow by a kindly old man who let them stay for a time in his small and humble cabin, surroundings that were far removed from the accommodations that Sunny, who was purchased from a professional breeder, and Bo, who was a gift from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), were used to. According to reports, the old man allowed the pair to join his team of sled dogs, who initially bullied the White House pets for their pampered backgrounds.

You call yourselves dogs, do you? said Avalanche, a hulking husky and the lead dog on the old mans sled team. Something tells me youve had everything in life handed to you on a silver dog dish. That may be the way things work in Washington, D.C., but around here we have to earn our keep. This is no place for lapdogs.

Later, sources stated, Sunny and Bo earned the respect of that same dog when they worked together to save several members of the sled team who had fallen through a patch of thin ice during a routine supply run.

Unbeknownst to the pair as they made their way across the country, the Obamas were said to be desperately trying to locate the pets they missed so much. According to sources, Sasha and Malia Obama put up flyers all around the nations capital and asked every congressman they encountered to keep an eye out for the dogs in their home districts. Reports indicate that Sasha also went to bed each night looking at an old photo of her beloved pets, promising aloud that they would all be reunited one day.

As the first dogs passed through the Midwest on their trek homeward, they reportedly came upon a small city where, much to their delight, they heard the unmistakable sound of their owners voice. Barking excitedly as they ran toward it, they are believed to have rounded a corner only to discover President Obama giving a speech on the screen of a television in an electronics store. Reports confirmed the pair, having caused quite a commotion, were then chased down the block by the towns dogcatcher, escaping only after Bo bit the man on the seat of his pants, causing him to yelp in pain and exposing his heart-patterned boxer shorts to passersby beneath the flap of torn fabric.

Some days later, Sunny and Bo appeared ready to give up, having convinced themselves they would never again sniff fresh tomatoes from Michelle Obamas vegetable garden or receive one of Treasury Secretary Jack Lews signature belly rubs. Deciding they were simply too tired and demoralized to continue onward, the pair are said to have stopped to sleep for the night in the bed of a beat-up, old pickup truck. Sources said they were jarred awake in the morning when the engine roared to life and the pickup lurched out onto the highway.

After initially panicking when they realized they were being driven to an unknown destination, the two dogs reportedly soon found themselves enjoying the breeze rushing through their fur and the vast stretches of ground they were quickly covering. Several hours later, the dogs are said to have smelled something familiar, perking their heads up over the tailgate and then howling in delight when they saw trees filled with pink cherry blossoms growing denser around them.

Wait a second, I recognize those barks, said President Obama, interrupting his introduction of a judicial nominee at a Rose Garden press conference to discover the dogs bounding across the South Lawn toward him. Quick, get Sasha and Malia! Oh, my goodness! Where on earth have you rascals been?

Everyone get out here! he continued, embracing Sunny and Bo as they eagerly licked his face and the first family came running to welcome them home. Theyre back!

At press time, Michelle Obama was reportedly rolling her eyes and saying I guess everythings back to normal as the family sat down for their first meal together since their reunion and heard the unmistakable sound of Bo lapping water from an East Wing toilet.",3

Rock-paper-scissors is a zero-sum hand game that can engage infinite players, explained Immigration Minister John McCallum. Players compete by simultaneously making one of three shapes with their fingers and outstretched hands. The game is regarded as one of the fairest and most respected selection processes in Western society.

This government is simply taking a much-needed common sense approach, stated McCallum. Canadians tell us they want a process that is fairer for people sponsoring family members, a process that is good enough to end bar disputes over the last pint of a pitcher, a process worthy of determining high stakes life changing decisions such as who has to get up and go to the kitchen for more chips during a Netflix binge.

Minister McCallum stated that the government plans to train hundreds of immigration officers to referee rock-paper-scissors. To address concerns over transparency, the process will be televised on TSN.

Ayaan Mashallah, who hopes to compete to bring his parents to Canada, stated: Where Im from our government determines access to social benefits with a nation-wide game of tic-tac-toe, but I will happily respect Canadas unique customs.

The federal government then unveiled an ambitious 90-point plan, tentatively titled Smokescreen 2017, that doesnt address indigenous issues, healthcare, or student debt, instead focusing on making weed like, super duper legal, you know?

A pediatric orthopedic surgeon by training, Leitch is also renowned in the medical community for being the first person to successfully remove her own heart. As Minister of Labour in the Harper Cabinet, Leitch was often tasked with handling many tough files. This included launching the Barbaric Practices Hotline, a number that Canadians could call to report repeated plays of Drake songs by DJs looking to meet CanCon requirements. Leitch has pinned her political future on expert campaigner/necromancer Nick Kouvalis, famous for getting infamous Toronto mayor Rob Ford elected, then getting John Tory elected to fix the mess made by Rob Ford. As a leadership candidate, she has clarified that shes not a racist, but simply holds traditionally racist values.

DT: Well I have someone who can write one for you that can sound so much like Michelle Obama, youll cry.

"221","295.txt","The Donalds Constitution","Now that Donald Trump is President and is assured a compliant Supreme Court, here are some of the changes we can expect to already existing Constitutional amendments.

1. Petitioning government for the rights of redress. Fagitaboutit. Freedom of expression and rights to free speech? How about freedom of oppression with no rights to impeach.

2. Right to bear arms. Yeah, and full freedom to use them, too.

3. No quartering of soldiers in private homes. How about no quartering of European businessmen in Trump Hotels?

8. Prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Thats why were going back to waterboarding at Guantanamo.

10. Federal only has powers delegated to it by the States. You can reverse that formula now.

11. Makes the States immune from suits from foreigners. Not when Trump is continuing to do business with foreign capital and foreign government.

12. Makes States immune from suits by foreigners. Not when Trump is doing business with them.

15. Prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Tell that to Trumps Mexican rapists and the prisoners in the criminal system.

16. Permits Congress to levy an income tax. Not if Trump keeps his promises to shield the one percent from higher taxes.

19. Prohibits denial of the right to vote based on sex. Tell that to the Groper-in-Chief.",3
"222","296.txt","Supremacy Now! Things White People Do Well","In light of the fact that a huge swath of white nationalists and separatists in the U.S.  from the hoary old KKK to neo-Confederates to garden-variety racists and assorted Bannonistas  are positively giddy at the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, perhaps its time to take stock of what it is, exactly, that whites do so well.

After all, tens of millions of Americans enthusiastically voted for a thin-skinned semi-literate, serial bankrupt and congenital groper who made a point of courting bigots and sectarians during his campaign. The least the rest of us can do is examine why so many white Americans remain so sure of their own racial supremacy, and why theyve embraced a character like Donald Trump as their knight in orange armor.

With that in mind, here in no particular order are a few things at which whites historically and unquestionably excel.

Killing Other White People  Contrary to Mr. Trumps puzzling insistence that 80 percent of whites killed in America are murdered by African Americans, pesky FBI statistics indicate that more than 80 percent of murdered white Americans are, in fact, killed by other whites. (Blacks accounted for less than 15 percent of white deaths in 2014, and a devastating 90 percent of black deaths. Neither of those statistics is anything to celebrate  but nor are they suggestive of the epidemic of black-on-white violence that Trump and other fact-averse racialists continue to bleat and tweet about.)

Walking on the Moon  To date, only 12 humans have walked on the moon. They were all white guys. Why do other races hate the moon so much? Why?

Avoiding Arrest for Illicit Drug Use  According to a survey conducted a few years ago by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, almost 20 percent of whites have used cocaine. For Latinos and blacks, that number is closer to 10 percent. White people have also used or abused prescription pain killers (Oxy, for example), hallucinogens, and stimulants like crystal meth at higher percentage rates than most other ethnic groups.

Despite these shenanigans, blacks are arrested for drug possession more than three times as often as whites  a discrepancy that might be due to racial bias, more aggressive policing in minority neighborhoods, or other law-enforcement vagaries. But isnt it just possible that the lower arrest rate for whites is due to the fact that some people are really good at getting away with enjoying illegal drugs, without attracting the attention of the po-po? How about some credit where credit is due?

Eating Competitively  A weirdly high percentage of the highest ranked competitive eaters in the world  men and women, alike  are white. This is exactly the sort of accomplishment that billions of people in the non-white world look upon with astonishment, and envy. And empty bellies. And disgust. But mostly envy.

Drinking Donkey Semen  Remember seeing those adorable Florida twins, Brynne and Claire Odioso, downing mugs of donkey semen and urine on an episode of Fear Factor a few years back? Yeah, neither do I, because the network decided not to air the footage. (NBC: Global arbiter of good taste!)

But the adorable Odiosos had a good time chatting about their experience after the fact  and who among us has not seen clips of other stomach-churning acts from the shows long, dignified run? Sure, there were some non-white contestants on Fear Factor, but evidently none had the heart or the class to chug donkey spunk in order to be on TV.

Saluting Like Nazis  As a recent alt-right conference in Washington, DC, makes plain, white people are still simply the best at giving Nazi-style salutes while hollering original slogans like, Hail Trump! Hail our people!

Now, by our people, the uber-homogeneous conference crowd might have been referring to the marvelously diverse, pluralistic society weve built here in America over centuries. But seeing as how keynote speaker and alt-right Grand Poobah Richard B. Spencer assured his audience that white people must conquer or die and that America belongs to us, the attendees probably did mean hail whites! after all. Which makes those straight-arm salutes that much more  Nuremberg-y.

Keeping Non-Whites From Voting  Give it up for the bright, white GOP: when it wants to make voting more difficult, instead of more accessible, for millions of Americans, todays Republicans know how to get all their cute little voter-suppression ducks in a row. In fact, this years presidential election was the first in 50 years in which full protections of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act were not enforced across the land. Talk about supremacy!

Being Hannity  As earnestly as people of color might yearn to be Bill OReillys angry, insecure niece, that role is now, and always will be, filled to perfection by Sean Hannity. Sorry, folks.

Again, these are but a few of the endeavors and pursuits at which whites excel. Any sentient human could come up with countless more. Hail our people, indeed.",3
"223","297.txt","PSYCHOLOGISTS URGE PEOPLE WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM TO WATCH G.O.P. DEBATE","MINNESOTA (The Borowitz Report)Psychologists at the University of Minnesota have issued a research study recommending that people suffering from low self-esteem watch Thursday nights nationally televised Republican debate.

The recommendation came after the psychologists spent weeks showing research subjects video clips of the debates potential participants and observed striking improvements in the subjects overall morale and sense of worth.

We interviewed the volunteers before we exposed them to the Republican candidates and afterward, said psychologist Davis Logsdon. The spike in their self-esteem was off the charts.

Of the candidates who most improved the research subjects sense of self, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush were found to be consistently helpful, but the most marked increase in self-esteem levels came after the subjects were exposed to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.
According to the data, people who viewed Walker for approximately three minutes reported feeling better right away about their intelligence, knowledge, and prospects for obtaining high-status employment that they had previously considered well beyond their reach.

After watching Governor Walker, a substantial number of the subjects literally could not remember why they had ever felt bad about themselves, Logsdon said.

In addition to recommending that low self-esteem-sufferers watch the debate, Logsdon is advising them to D.V.R. the entire two hours. You never know when you might need it again, he said.",3
"224","298.txt","JINDAL SAYS HE DIDNT WANT TO BE IN LAME DEBATE ANYWAY","CLEVELAND (The Borowitz Report)After being told that he did not poll well enough to participate in Thursdays nationally televised Republican Presidential debate, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal told reporters that it was no big deal, seriously, because I didnt want to be in that lame debate anyway.

I mean, at first it sounded like the debate might be cool, but, you know, the more I looked at it, it seemed like it was going to be pretty lame, Jindal said. I mean, look at some of the people who got chosen to do itlike Ted Cruz. I mean, seriously, Ted freaking Cruz? Thats going to be a lame debate.

Jindal said that, instead of participating in the debate, he was going to host a party for the other Republican candidates who were not chosen for it.
I just sent out the Evite, and its looking good, Jindal said. Carly Fiorina, in. Rick Perry, in. That dude who used to be the governor of New York, in. I seriously just sent out the Evite, and all these awesome people are yeses.

Were going to have loads of snacks, and, yes, adult beverages will be served, Jindal said of the festivities. Its going to be a righteous party, and way better than being at some lame debate.",3
